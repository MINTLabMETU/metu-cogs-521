would any competent local bike shop able fix anything the bike. also are some parts really that hard find including inch wheels. thats the only thing keeping me from buying birds. having hard time fixing the bike and end up with useless bike or bike that would take long time fix due waiting for parts arrive and or LBS not being able fix it.
