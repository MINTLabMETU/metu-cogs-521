was hoping some here could hep me with tire question. currently have Primo Comet x tires my Swift. like them but have had couple flats in the past year do about miles weekly in Brooklyn and manhattan and now have decided that want something little tougher. from reading this forum it seems the Big Apples are the way for me go. so here is my question. do need Big Apples that are the same exact size x or will my rims fit wider tired
