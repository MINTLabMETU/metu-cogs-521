from the specs looks mckirdy. they made it the around. the mckirdy .Mkhas disc brakes and redesigned front fork. so the bike in Fremont is most likely something few years old but NOS. support in the for birds is pretty dismal the moment. if you wanted mckirdy you might have order direct from Pacific Cycles. that being said birds is great riding small wheel bike. most of the drivetrain parts are generic so thats not issue in the. there are plenty of aftermarket bits from Asia .
