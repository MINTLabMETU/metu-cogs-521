started off with used Roubaix and love it. paid next nothing for it without wheels and just got set of new take off magic for. added tires and tubes and road that thing happily until got frame frame instead of the since the was just too big. it has dura ace shifters and rear depailler that shifts like butter. have been told it will even better with new cassette and cables which should run less than total. total costs for the bike was around and it shifts just as good if not better than my new tarmac with full ultra it.
