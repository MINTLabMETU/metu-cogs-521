okay this thread is maybe not quite as relevant as ever. but just picked up Surly Cross Check frame around when this thread started and still around today and came here for answer variation our now age-old question If switch from drop bars flat bars keeping stock brakes what levers do use. my next question would Why do the stock teatro Oryx brakes provide so little stopping power. bought the bike just slightly used. but the breaks seriously have little no power. would adjustment and new brake shoes give me something worth bothering with. since rarely if ever ride in mud here in the semi-desert part of Colorado my inclination is give up cantilever entirely and go with TRP CXshortarm linearpull cyclocross brakes. little less clearance lot more stopping power hear. if did that what flatter levers would use. those are general questions. does anyone have specific stateoftheart but notfreakishlyexpensive recommendations for specific flatter brakelever models go with the Oryx santis or the CXlinearpulls. thanks for the opportunity participate in the Worlds Oldest thread
