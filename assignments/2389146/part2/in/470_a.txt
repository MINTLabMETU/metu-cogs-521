had chance ride the nonRohloff version in Berlin last summer and found it very responsive even lively. decided stay with my Giant Expressway folder which retrofitted with chainbased roelof. absolutely ADORE my hub. ive had zero problems with it it is easy shift when moving or stopped and it just works. some gears are little louder than others which does serve help you know which gear it is in. you also have just slightly back off the pressure when shifting but you dont have stop the pedals. but the linearlyspaced gears are just joy ride. recommend testing the birds and if you like the general ride definitely recommend the Rohloff.
