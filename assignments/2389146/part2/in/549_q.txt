well speed wasnt my goal. also got improved ride quality as the larger wheel rides over roots and logs better. knowing that helps when you pick line and ibm riding stuff that my FS would handle but my a HT has issues with. attendant with new bike is better tires that are tuneless and run much less air pressure so less bounce off objects as well as tire designed for that pressure so better grip in turns and while climbing. and which has terrific range for where ride and makes it easier not dealing with when front shift. plus improved geometry which makes the her killer climbing bike. and wider bars that help with control. you can retro lot of this into a wheeled bike and if had really light and good carbon a bike could see doing tubelesswide barset. and id bet it would great bike but sometimes its cost effective go new bike
