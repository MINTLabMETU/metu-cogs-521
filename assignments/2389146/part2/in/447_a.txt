have just got my VIII with the suspension fork. it does have small hole in the dropout that would allow you mount front fender brace if you wanted. you could move the rear fender the front. would guess it would good fit and they you could get clip-on Freddy Fender or other rear fender all for about. one real advantage of the short rear fender which have not seen mentioned is that the lack of fenders makes it easy roll the bike around when folded. use velcro strap fasten the fork crown the rear rack. with the stem folded down between the two wheels and the handlebars strapped the top tube the bike rolls nicely while using the seat as handle. will try and post picture later. if you had full-length fenders the bike could not rotated back far enough let it roll its wheels. the rolling position has the frame hinge directly above the bottom bracket. the bike is then balanced and rolls easily. the only minor problem is replaced the folding pedals with spd and the left pedal rubs little the front tire while in this position
