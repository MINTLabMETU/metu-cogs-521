bought used classic birds pre Craigslist. the price was right and like it lot. had ridden borrowed newermodel birds before and loved the ride. ive also test ridden Bike and some other folders but hate the rough ride of smallwheeled bike without suspension especially in front. the birds got has no fendersmudguards or rack. dont need rack but would like fendersmudguards. the local birds dealers Warm Planet in San Francisco and Urban Bike Fitters in Fremont CA USA say the classic birds models lack the mounting points for the current Birdyspecific racks or fenders. does anyone know currentlyavailable fendermudguard set that will fit classic birds. im willing do some hacking make it fit but Im not expect and dont want drill the frame. once upon time fendersmudguards were made for the classic birds. somewhere there is probably NOS set collecting dust in the back of shop. does anyone know of birds dealer that might likely have one. im in the USA but Im going in Amsterdam and Brussels next month probably with my birds. can anyone recommend shop in either of those cities that sells lot of birds or that has large variety of folding bike accessories and might have something that could made fit my older birds. ive posted separate message about the size of folded classic birds as airline luggage slightly related only the extent that fendersmudguards might slightly increase the folded dimensions. thanks for any tips experience or advice. edward
