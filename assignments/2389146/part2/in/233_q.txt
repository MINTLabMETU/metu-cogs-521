this thread. this thread is only months younger than am. this is both inspiring and slightly terrifying. personally use pair of shaman cantilever that bought last fall. the old models of shaman cantilever brakes used plastic part hold the spring in position and these broke very easily. the new ones are actually pretty great quality all metal and are holding up well winter riding. cantilever are bit better for me as ride in snow and they tend leave more clearance around the wheel. they have plenty of stopping power are easy fix and most importantly are CHEAP which is big deal for someone in my economic standing unemployed minor. will concede though that more evil adjust braking system would hard come by. installing both of them took more than hour and most of that was Step adjust Step tighten if bumped while tightening go step Step test if badly aligned loosen and go step Step ride if badly adjusted return step one
