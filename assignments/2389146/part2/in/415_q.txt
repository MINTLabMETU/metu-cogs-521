this is my first post here. have downturn VI and downturn VIII the older version with just the wrong suspension and Trek comfort bike. really love the downturn bikes. was going put out the money for damon but the reach between the seat and the handlebar is just too far for me comfortable no matter how high or low put the bar. and the downturn is much better value. im glad dint get the damon because it would just sitting around unbidden. the VI is blast ride. replaced the freewheel with for the hills around here. but it was just too heavy for me lug around with my back problems so got VIII when they came out. other than putting some binkie lights and handlebar bag it the only modification is bunch of parts from various places sitting in box. have SRAM upped drivetrain with cassette ready install but probably wont do it until spring. for anyone getting downturn would advise going for the sped option as couldnt do it for even with getting everything sale the shifter depailler cassette and chain from various auctions and sales came about bucks and who knows when you might need that extra gear because of big hills or getting older Im sixty and overweight. my question is and maybe Yan knows this if buy Mini and the handlebar height is wrong for me can remove the whole folding stem assembly from the VI and fit it the Mini or would it not fit. also as understand it the hub only comes with or tooth cog and wonder which the mini has. and one other really do want internal hub bike for around here north of Seattle so if dint get the Mini do you have any ideas lowering the gearing the larger hub bike. the gearing is just way too high for me. thanks flyingwolf
