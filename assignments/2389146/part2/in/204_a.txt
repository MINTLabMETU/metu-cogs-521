are you really that obtuse. what it means in the context of this thread read post is that the availability of bikes from the major bike manufacturers is in decline. as each year passes the major manufactures are starting phase out bikes just like they phased out bikes. most people are going for so thats what manufactures are going supply. giant is perfect examples of this. few years ago they went all in. they had only few. now they have been slowly phasing them out. think they learned that going all in was mistake. for models Giant had eight and five. for Giant has eleven and three. by you probably can expect that giant will have one or two offerings. sure.parts and service items will available for long time. but thats not what this thread is about
