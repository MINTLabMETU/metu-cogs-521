hi my first post here. havent owned bike since childhood Im now and now Im in the process of looking for road bike model buy. found one like my local store but it has no drop handlebars which really need for my riding. know there are handlebars sale the web but not sure if they would fit that bike. do handlebars fit any bike or if not what are the technical specs check if they will this bike model. thanks in advance
