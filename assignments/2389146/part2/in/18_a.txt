havent looked the groups but the chief difference between the two models is relaxed v. racing geometry. the Sportif is the former. do you want more upright. get the Sportif. want feel aggressive i.e. lower. get the Roubaix. go for ride with your Roubaix if you dont like the necklower back pain which gets better as you accustom the position switch out. im guessing you got it Performance Bike in which case you have full year make up your mind
