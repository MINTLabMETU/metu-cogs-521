havent rode tri bike before but have been told they can little unstable if your not used it. as far as the group goes find the approximate year of the bikes. goole search them and use images narrow down the exact year by comparing colors and graphics the frame. from there use bikepedia verify the original group. if you are traveling far see it ask for pics of each component if there are reluctant share there is probably good reason and you should by from them.
