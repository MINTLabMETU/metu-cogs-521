one thing the pictures of all bikes that stops me from buying is the fender size and mounting. the rear one is too short when installed such similar bike httpvelosite.rucatalog.ssid my back and head were completely covered with dirt. also absence of front fender makes the frame dirty not only starting the bottom bracket but completely from the front fork. the good thing about suspension front fork is that it has brake and disk mounts the same time so can install disc brakes for winter but from the pictures it does not have fender mounts all
