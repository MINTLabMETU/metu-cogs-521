hi big boy phil Very close in my opinion. see my postspics page and page. you can certainly run ultra components most of it. here are the compromises you have make. doull need the aluminium door Swift frames with the rear derailed hanger unless you put in special order with Peter or the Center for Appropriate Transport if your going down the all steel path. no front depailler although you could fit double chairing and shift from the big little chairing by hand theres reference that somewhere in this thread and its the way they used do it long time ago. gearing your going need either much larger chairing than the normal cranks or much smaller sprocket. bike sell sell large chairing not sure if they fit the ultra cranks. ta Specialities also provide outsize chairing. alternatively you could run shamans care rear cassette teeth. bike and Moulton have modified this cassette so it runs from or. however if you do this doull need the care rear hub. if you use just one front chairing the ultra short cage derailed should adequate if you end up with two chairing doull need the long cage version. brakes. dont think that shamans dual pivot brakes will fit. im not home so cant check. if you decide run with drop bars and shaman ultra drifters then you have options use V brakes with these levers. use online. travel Agent use teatro mini brakes use one of the new low profile cantilever. use tetras top of the line mini Vs if was going down this path. ive read mixed reviews about Travel Agents and the low profile santis from Avid teatro Cane Creek when fitted as rear brake tend catch your heel when your peddling. the other option is use DiacompeDiatech V brake specific brake levers with bar end shifter. see my post above. you might also like check out the information Alex westmore bicycle pages especially about small wheeled bikesfolders. you can build up wheels narrow rims Alex Velocity and use narrow high pressure tyres from either schwab or Continental. look forward seeing how you go. oziswift
