also noticed the rear wheel was much slower than the front wheel when spun in open air but dont know whether this affects the bike when theres more weight it. think friction can have sort of breaking point so that once the force applied moving the bike through gravity weight inertia etc is strong enough the force slowing the wheel down actually becomes less. it seems me like the Mini can coast forever when Im riding it but yes it does spin far in the open air
