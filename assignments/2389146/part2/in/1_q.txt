mph int bad if you are new and getting into shape. just resumed riding last year after about years off and used get passed all the time. now some people pass me and pass some others. yes cadence is important you need find whats best for you is reasonable starting point. is your seat high enough. sitting the seat with your heel the pedal its lowest point your leg should completely straight this is starting point adjust from there. where do you place your feet the pedals when riding. ball of foot should over the center of the pedal. are your tires fully inflated. how much do you weigh. if you are near or more run the rear tire maximum pressure per the tire sidewall front can less try it there and adjust your own preference. is your bike well adjusted. brakes not dragging. shifts well. wheels run true. shifting shift so that you can comfortably maintain your cadence especially dont overstress your knees by pushing too hard. doull run higher gear riding downwind than you will upwind. when Im riding trails that pass under roads if the trail is otherwise level Ill often not shift all or just up or down one gear just depends how feel how fast Im going how crowded the trail is etc. but when was starting out shift down my front granny gear coming up the other side. also started doing some stretches and exercises for hamstrings IT band leg muscles core and back. dont expect overnight results but you should see steady progress. went from gasping after miles in riding metric century in and feeling tired but good when was done. it is lot of things all cumulative. again seat height is crucial
