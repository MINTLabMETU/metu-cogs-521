hello. am new obviously and am hoping get some advice what bike buy for both myself and my husband. right now are looking getting used bikes kijiji so our options are fairly limited. for myself there is giant avail and trek. the giant is and the trek is asking. are these fair prices and which would better choice. would triathlon bike bad choice. finally is there any way for me sure that they havent switched out the groupies the bikes. for the avail am not overly convinced that its actually the model she is telling me it is. she says its the giant avail which would have the shaman shifters but dont think she knows what she is talking about as she was very reluctant tell me the model number and her ad is very vague. any suggestions. thanks so much Josie
