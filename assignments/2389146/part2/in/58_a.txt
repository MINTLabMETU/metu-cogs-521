okay. had assumed that was sarcasm and he was really supporting mabs. guess missed that one totally. wonder if for the pros it is different. watching them TV they seem Never slow down. but for me MTB riding is as you describe it short bursts of effort followed by hopefully enough recovery tackle the next section. only downside mabs IMO is that it is hard take relaxed MTB ride. guess could ride the jeep trails but that is just road biking packed dirt. feel need certain level of wholebody fitness tackle the real trails. its only downside because lost all that fitness and it is coming back too slowly .
