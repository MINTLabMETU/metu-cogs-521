the risk of beating dead horse would say that is fine. each his own. havent jumped curb in over years. and dont see many adults doing stuff like that. life is too short risk it and tire tube and rim jumping curbs. but do take my Salsa gravel or occasionally grass dirt crushed limestone broken pavement or whatever. because my bike has touring wheels and substantial tires. panaracer ribao in mm though am going try some dirt and gravel riding in the spring Panaracer Gravel King. dont ride much sidewalks if can help it. thought might like classic handrail mountain bike for more rustic rides but can count the times one hand have actually ridden my Trek in the last two years. but why. have wide but smooth tires. suspect it is the riding position combined with the flat bars the heavy tires and the wheels. the bike just feels sluggish. there eventually place like ride that is too rustic for my Salsa where might find handrail mountain bike just the thing but havent found it yet. now maybe am just old curmudgeon but do think have tried love my old mountain bike. but discovered in short order single track int my thing and for general use bike with wheels and tires more in the mm is about right for me. few am not alone in that assessment. my teenage son races mountain bikes and actually prefers single track roads. but when he is riding around town pavement he much prefers his road bike as it is much more fun ride pavement. while others disagree dont think my experience is atypical. see the enjoyment my son gets from mountain biking but even he only rides his mountain bike when he does single track
