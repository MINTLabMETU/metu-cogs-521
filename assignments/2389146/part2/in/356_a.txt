titanium int generally used for big stuff like the airframe or skint least no plane ever worked. back in the it was all aluminum. ti is typically used for higher temp applications eg jet engine exhaust flow control where individual parts agent large. ti is used more extensively in the SR which had friction heated wings mach speeds. many assemblies were loose room temperature cut operating dimensions were only achieved much higher inflight temps. but one can make big things with rivets which can make very strong assemblies. and gas shielded welding works better with simply shaped parts
