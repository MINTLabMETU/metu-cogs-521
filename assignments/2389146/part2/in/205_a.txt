no am not obtuse. here lets look that post again. in that context as you yourself agree the OP could buy and have parts and service for their bike for long time. whatever is happening statistically in the market does not effect the individual once they buy their bike. they have it parts are available it should last good while. so. within the OPs context is not dead though that term is weak. more accurately as described in my response it will not suffer from availability issues parts but fall out of popular favour if that is the sole motivating factor for buying bike. however rest assured any bike purchased today will also fall out of popular favour in couple of years anyway. can answer this two ways If you find you like. buy it. there will parts available for long time enjoy your ride. if you find you like. dont buy it. there will parts available for long time but is more popular so you wont enjoy your ride
