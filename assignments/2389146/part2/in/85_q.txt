no. not correct. the faster you go the harder you work. it int so much miles as calories burned per hour ridden. machine that allows you ride efficiently is faster which will increase aerodynamic drag by orders of magnitude which the cyclist will have work harder overcome road cyclist moving along or mph is working orders of magnitude harder than the same cyclist riding mountain bike mph. and the fast moving road cyclists will ride much further in the same period of time getting better workout. same distance similar intensity sure doull burn more calories the bike that makes the exercise take longer. thats not how people tend plan rides though if Im faster bike and intend similar sort of workout Ill likely go faster and farther
