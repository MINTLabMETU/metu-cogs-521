want small part of this long running thread its birthday was last month. now the topic hand. last year our son replaced the teatro Oryx cantilever brakes his older Surly Long Haul Trucker with V brakes. he says the V brakes are far easier adjust and work better than the stock tetras. so theres that. the other hand. . . maybe santis agent that hard adjust. yes for years had heard that adjusting cantilever brakes was difficult so avoided the job. recently the cantilever brakes my old Trek were squealing they were toed in enough and was going bring the bike in for adjustment until my son pointed me this Park Tool video described by one commented as the Citizen Kane of cantilever smooth post videos httpswww.youtube.comwatch.vGtDymo After watching the video was able fix the toxin problem with my santis. thanks Park Tool. maybe its just question of good instruction. maybe somebody else can celebrate this threads birthday next april
