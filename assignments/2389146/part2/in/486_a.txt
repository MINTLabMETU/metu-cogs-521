interesting prospect minimize gearing birds. ive had few birds bikes through the years both with the excellent Sachs the SRAM Dual Drive as well as straight depailler gearing. if you went with small high or speed any hub with more gears gets pretty heavy wheel although birds does offer roelof version you would still need chain pensioner handle the excess chain when folding as well as maintaining normal riding tension compensate for the vertical dropouts. coaster brakes dont work well with spring loaded tensioners or derailleurs. if wanted reduce gearing and convert birds high use as commuter consider speed doncaster with small chain pensioner. you lose the weight of the cassette large depailler and one shiftercable combo. ride Moulton speed high all the time and find the gearing sufficient for moderately hilly Marin county roads
