much like this thread the debate will never die. though have upgrade question about the two. backstay Im newer the off road side of cycling and have Frankenbike that is slowly becoming monstercrossrigid single track bike. my levers are shaman peed and Cane Creek SCR It currently has generic no label shaman Cantilevered brakes with pool stops BUT In my spares bin have both upgraded santis Avid short and V brakes Avid Single digit. like the modulation of the santis and have only found myself wanting more power the steepest of descents. realize that will need travel agents if go v brakes but want pick up the wide cable hangers if stick with santis so can move tire so it is bust price. both need new pads again even cost. am total loss about which one go with.even after reading all years of this thread please help. pic is unrelated
