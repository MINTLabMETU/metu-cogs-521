the bicycle industry is totally fashion driven so going another wheel standard is common practice in the interest of promoting new bicycle sales. the bicycle industry is roughly billion dollars year. this is big money. wal-mart sells lot of bicycle shaped devices. wal-mart probably alone sells more bicycles than brand name Trek Specialized Giant combined. lot of the bicycles are made by Giant anyway and branded for wal-mart or others. was not able access the exact percentage of the bicycle market that wal-mart services but Im sure it is huge. see WalmartTarget bikes being ridden by adults in their endeavours all the time. see more of those bicycles being used than brand name bicycles. wal-mart sells huge amounts of children bicycles as you brought up but their products are being used by vast amounts of adult cyclists. if wal-mart continues sell wheeled bicycles including mabs then that wheel size not die off like the wheel size did. still ride wheeled bicycle because parts are easy come by and cheap all these many years after the last new ones were sold. like you Ill keep eye the experiment maybe it is going away. who knows
