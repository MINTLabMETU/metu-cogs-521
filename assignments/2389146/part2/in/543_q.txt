im pro mechanic and Ive never totally got why some people are so into King. the being is certainly fantastic and Ive never encountered bad product of theirs but their performance int amazingly exceptional. like mind Cane Creek headsetseasy find replacement bearings great tolerances sane price versions for pretty much every possible headset standard. really any kind of headset service is in most cases fairly infrequent and not particularly onerous dont get highly prioritizing long wear this part. their hubs are unique and Ill say that they do seem have great service life and as wrench there entertaining service but really there are lot of really good options in the market that are lighter have higher engagement or both lower prices. would have hard time choosing very premium hub unless had like absolutely top tier groups the rest of the bike name brand carbon rims etc. think part of their success is that they only make parts the high end and their products are highly visible and nearly never stock builds. its way say or depending the canonization scream that youse got slick custom build
