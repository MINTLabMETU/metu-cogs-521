in years no mechanic has ever touched my bikes. but think Ill have run into town and have someone do these damn wheels. ive already busted one tire lever and Im afraid Ill end up damaging the beads. what really dont like is when Im out the trail it will always in my head that if get puncture and the sealant wont work which happens Ill walking because theres no way in hell would able put tube in. dont like that. sometimes old technology is just better no matter what the new generation says and this is prime example. that being said if were you would convert it tuneless because your chances of getting flat are reduced. you agent going able take that tube out and patchreplace it the trail. least sure as hell int.
