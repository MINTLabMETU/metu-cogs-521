thanks for this detailed post. today was able ride one end of the trail which is about miles with some minimal head winds and averaged mph and did it in which is progress compared my previous rides. the ride back home another miles averaged mph and did it in minutes. also noticed that wasnt huffing and puffing nor did feel the excruciating pain in my thighs like the last few rides. the awareness of my cadence really helped know for fact was peddling aaaaa too slow cadence my last few rides because dint even know what cadence was LOL. for the first half of the ride typically stayed in the middle cassette the front and gear the back headwind and the way back stayed in the middle cassette the front and the back. as for shifting took your advice and dint worry too much about major shifting for small dips and uphill. did shift accordingly keep my cadence high going uphill and it helped tremendously. for the first time today actually felt like made tremendous improvement and feel that if keep it can only get better. thanks lot
