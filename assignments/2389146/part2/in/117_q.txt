warning My Tern Cargo Node based split in half while riding yesterday. just under miles and it broke in two while slowing down intersection. could have been much worse. this is not safe conversion. picture from redd it dot com It is dead because think there is censorship bot in this forum. what you can do is click the link and replace the arteries with redd it dot com. the hinge failure is recent like maybe several ago but the bike could old model plus nodded with electric motor
