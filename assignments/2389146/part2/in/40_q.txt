way more. love being able turn off the hard-top onto footpath before busy intersections rumble through the grass and then jump the curb around the corner and continue my way. or simply stay the sidewalk navigating concrete bumpy dirt or long grass. often the best choice very busy section of road and nice diversion after miles of speeding through the back roads. have never seen anyone racer do it. many claim they can but have seen it in the real world
