my Salsa does most of that and can even handle some light touring. handling flats is mostly function of tires. ride with Panaracer ribs. only flats in years which int bad. dont do time trials do you. bit of slight of hand smashing together mountain bikes and hybrids. can see person going with hybrid as do it all bike though personally prefer drop bars. the other hand agree with OP modern lower priced mountain bikes suck as all rounders
