new birds spec chairing freewheel running the numbers through gear inch calculator compute range of. the New birds forged stem has function which not many people knows. the upper stem can rotate change the degree not sure if this info will help you but couldnt know this if dint visit Pacific museum. however Pacific also do offer the degree stem as optional accessory. this did not know.but think the degree net change would negligible. its possible that the or degree stem would my preference but its nice know if would have the option of change. pacific museum staffs also told me the reason they spec mechanical disc brakes is prevent problems from folding unfolding. that makes sense me. the origin of my uncertainty is that somewhere noting that Ive spent lot of time researching birds details and options online read that the disk model was hydraulic statement that contradicted most of what had read. have the birds standard model and the original components are good for me. hope these helps
