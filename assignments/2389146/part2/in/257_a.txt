pepi you beat me the punch. that is exactly what am using and is very inexpensive part. btw for anyone with similar problem many different companies make one.you can get pyramid or other inexpensive brand depailler hanger and it will work exactly the same as one from bigger name ie. more expensive company. if you want depailler that work fine. juan
