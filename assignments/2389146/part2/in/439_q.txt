my Mini is in the hospital. the bottom bracket was so stuck couldnt budge it with breaking bar or impact driver this after letting it soak in liquid wrench applied from both sides for about hour. hopefully the LBS will able get it out without damaging the frame. hope get it back this evening so Ill let you know how it turns out. yan you might want check how these BBs are being installed the factory. the contrive side which was able remove there was only the slightest bit of grease antisense the threads. or better still you might want spec the shaman BB start with. doubt that anyone would complain about price increase especially when the alternative is early BB failure and then the hassle of trying get the current one out
