got these TRP minis after reading about them bike touring forum somewhere. too lazy pull down the bike the moment but heres the fork. the pivot positions are pretty spot. like Ive said plenty of power with these rims. also remember rim quality also makes difference. for cheap rime consider Alex Adventure. they perform nearly as well as my cliffhanger and tvs for fraction of cost. ill snap more this weekend if you need better angles or close ups
