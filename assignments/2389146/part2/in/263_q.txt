sorry dont have pic of the bike folded with the rack in site as have now removed it. have been experimenting with various options since bought my Swift and have settled the carradine SQR system which allows the fitting of SQR bag or with optional bracket conventional saddle bag. it allows variety of luggage possibilities without getting in the way of the fold as the bags can removed very quickly. the rack nicely above the rear wheel without much hangover all. also think it looked OK. its the right of the rack above the wheel that affects the fold. the closer the wheel the rack is the closer the seat post it goes when folded and this can stop the seat post dropping all the way. the one had allowed the seat post drop nearly all the way certainly enough hold the bike together. do have some pics of the bike with the rack in place but they are too big post this site. if can fathom out how reduce them will display them.
