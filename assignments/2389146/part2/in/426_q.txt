great idea. guess could go TAP plastics and have them cut couple of clear acrylic rings with drill holes for the bolts. hmmm. do let know what you come up with also. im very pleased with the way it turned out. im new folders and its just blast. ive virtually rebuilt both of the DTs just got. the silver one rolls pretty smooth. other than the ribbing from my friends e.g. hey doughnut boy. or what you do put your bike in the dryer. or In this cold weather everything shrinks. the bike is very enjoyable ride. oh yeah and the best part is passing people them small wheels. im planning doing century with it some time soon. will post ride report
