in both left and right the smaller shifter gets the chain smaller gear and the bigger one larger gear. the effective meaning is that shift the front you need tap the larger shifter. shift the rear you use the smaller shifter. if the front gear remains the same rear gear achieves higher gear ratio shift. if the rear remains the same front does it.
