hi kb Check out the specs my Swift posted page. im running SRAM Dual Drive. twist shifter HubBub adaptor one bar end bar end shifter the other. there are couple of pics there too. when researching the issue of using drop bar levers with V or mechanical disk brakes came across couple of sites that dint find Travel Agents or similar solutions satisfactory. youse three other alternatives. use DiacompeDiatech V brake specific levers or use short pull mini brake set up as used BMX bikes see. teatro have upgraded their mini brake range see. these brakes will work with road brake levers. if you check out the mini brakes these two pages you could find something that suits doull need model with this specification Brake Lever situation Short Pull such as the bus There are also whole new range of low profile cantilever Avid Cane Creek teatro appearing cross bikes that use normal drop bar levers. only trouble with small wheels is that big feet tend catch the rear cantilever. check out and ask Sheldon what he would do. think my brother is running Avid low profile cantilever with shaman levers Moulton with roelof speed internal hub. hope this helps
