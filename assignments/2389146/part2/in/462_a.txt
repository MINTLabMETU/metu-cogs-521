strangely this rack does not have the threaded hole bolt the rolling wheels. have since drilled and cut thread into it and now it has the small wheels from the Brompton rack Im waiting for the carbon seat post and sport handlebar post arrive so they will go next. sadly my spare wheels did not fit due the tyres it. looks like doull have run skinny kojak able fit. shelf that idea for now. deciding if should get some mudguards
