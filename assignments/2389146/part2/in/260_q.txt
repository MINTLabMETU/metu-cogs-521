all you with fixed Swifts or hunger Swifts. my hunger Swift dropped the chain for the first time today. it went back really easily and when look it and think about chain tension guess chainstretch has just crept up me without me noticing. so the question is should just move the rear wheel back take up the slack and readjust my gear cable. or is the chain potentially close wearing out and needs replacing. ive never had chain stretch this noticeably before and Ive had hunger bikes for years. thanks Magnus
