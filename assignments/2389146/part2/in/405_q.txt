the Mauna Kea bike DT FS frame has FSA cranks branded as NB. sale price was about irc. think used x BB because would the large chain ring most of the time. the d works fine. but the d cable path and cable stop is home brew as you can see in the six. thought about going without d but would stopping manually shift too often. for hilly SF would mount d mm. if were going the smaller ring more would use x. using the x had drexel the d inner cage flange get the care combination work right
