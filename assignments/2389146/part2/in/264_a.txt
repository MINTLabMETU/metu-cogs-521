well dont have carradine bag. but my laptop does fit in my nashwan waterproof front panniers and commute with it every. ive been meaning post for while but never got around taking pictures. continue do all my shopping and errands my Swift and if you click my blow link below doull see some pics of the bike loaded up with panniers TP. the panniers fit fine the rack but did decide modify the lower pannier mounting since had nothing for the hook attach. the beady-eyed amongst you also see Ive added fenderesmudguards. there zeal kids ones which only cost from French restore and happen fit rather well. they also snap detach in few seconds so very convenient for somewhere like SF that is mostly sunny but gets really wet when it first chooses rain
