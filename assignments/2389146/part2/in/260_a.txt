magnus Yeah if you can put the chain back really easily then the chain is too slack. check for chain stretch but before you do check make sure your rear hub haunt slid forward in the track ends Swifts dont have dropouts. also check for chain alignment. ive let my chain run really slack my dixie for while and never had it drop my hairline is within of deacon. also what kind of chain do you have or single. ive stretched through PC chain my SS pretty quickly. find that are much more durable and are far less prone drop than multispeed chains
