not your thread but. thought it was about the OPs concern regarding possible manoeuvrability issue going instead of and worrying about replacing worn out bike with new one in the near future. they have seems like they like but are worried might go away by then. it seems is still available in the near future and can assume after that the concern is about finding parts for that bike. if is any guide there should ample parts fix it down the road. the manoeuvrability issue really depends the rider size. if they are larger probably no problem but if they are smaller in stature they find bit much push around. heres the OP lets confirm
