this is going the route take. dint want do it but after you and Wheels explain it it makes more sense. hopefully riding bike is like riding car and you can figure out what you like and what you dont after while. also thanks ton for looking Craigslist for me. ive looked some many of those cant tell whats worth it and whats not so you narrowing it down helped ton. looked the Bicycle rulebook and it seems the Trek or is overpriced so low balled him for. the pink Trek Im showing is valued much higher than asking so that looks good deal. new seat screwdriver and some new tape will have that looking great
