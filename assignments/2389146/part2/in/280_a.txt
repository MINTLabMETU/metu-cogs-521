thanks. yes it is very nice ride. everything sort of fits together. the frame has great patina that can not watched photo it looks like it has been ridden and taken good care of for years and years. that matches great with the look of the antique saddle and the wingnuts etc. interesting detail think the original rear fitting of the frame was mm and has been fitted mm later it was when got it. refitted it mm trackside width which is clear commitment singlespeedfixed. is anybody familiar with the measurements of the early swifts. use fixed the front chainwheel. as my hub is flip-flop would enjoy having freewheel as option. but the smallest freewheel available for my hub has. for me that is unreadable with ring in the front because enjoy slow and hard peddling. sadly chairing bigger than are not really available. would need something like for good ride with freewheel and tire. so will stick my fixed ratio. the lacingpattern my front-wheel is not too much of trick. and if it is will happily reveal it got very inspired by Mr. christian solid who is german guru in terms of bicycle technics. the man who built racebike weighing incredible kg. in case of my steel swift it is of course more about the idea than saving weight. my bike shows kg the scale. result the pattern shown the images below just follow the logic of classic double crossed lacing but skip every third hole. it will good idea close the holes of the missing spokes avoid dirt getting inside. ill do that with some simple adhesive film soon. also experimented with triple crossing but due the small wheel diameter the spokes got terribly bent in the area of the flanges. probably even nifty SINGLE crossed spokes holes pattern would work. will try that next time. ps. used the same lacingpattern BOTH wheels of my antonini racebike gear sprocket. works great. spokes seem far too much .
