new birds spec chairing freewheel The New birds forged stem has function which not many people knows. the upper stem can rotate change the degree not sure if this info will help you but couldnt know this if dint visit Pacific museum. however Pacific also do offer the degree stem as optional accessory. pacific museum staffs also told me the reason they spec mechanical disc brakes is prevent problems from folding unfolding. have the birds standard model and the original components are good for me. hope these helps
