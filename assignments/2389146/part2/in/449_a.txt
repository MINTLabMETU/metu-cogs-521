as update bought tiara front depailler off bay and installed it protect against chain drop. did not routeinstall cables for the d since dont intend shift with it. bought double depailler but should have gotten triple. it needed the wider cage. ended up just manually widening the cage so it could accommodate the entire gears. im hoping that will take care of the problem for good. now all my planned modifications are complete. im very happy with it. its gorgeous bike see pictures posted earlier. guess Ill have go find another bike tinker with eh
