thought might like classic handrail mountain bike for more rustic rides but can count the times one hand have actually ridden my Trek in the last two years. but why. have wide but smooth tires. suspect it is the riding position combined with the flat bars the heavy tires and the wheels. the bike just feels sluggish. there eventually place like ride that is too rustic for my Salsa where might find handrail mountain bike just the thing but havent found it yet
