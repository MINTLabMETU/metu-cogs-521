correct. one would think if riding mountain bikes roads were such great training tool you would see more racers and riders in general using them for that purpose. and yet most of the mountain bikers see roads as opposed trails are moving along mph or slower. the real mountain bikers leave their mountain bikes home in favor of road bikes when they train the road
