im toying with the idea of reducing the number of speeds my birds has as winter project. my birds currently has Sram Dual Drive x hub with Sram cassette. when paired with the tooth chairing have it the bike is capable of ridiculously massive gear inch range which is fun but ultimately its setup that is completely unnecessary. i mean cant even use the top gear unless Im going downhill. but when can easily can hit mph. going uphill is ridiculously easy spinning out in lower. so. with my current gearing can tackle virtually any hill up or down and have multitude of speed options in the flats. however. since my birds is used of the time for commuting work find myself ever only using THREE gears. this has me thinking. simplify. im considering actually going in the complete opposite direction and dropping my number of gears match the purpose of this bike and if Im going change the hub why not consider losing the excess cabling and consider coaster brake. questions FOR YOU ALL. im curious if anyone has ever tried using coaster brake hub any speed. single two three seven etc. their birds. if so what was your experiences with coaster hub birds
