do you like the aesthetics of fixes or are you actually intending ride with fixed gear i.e. no coasting. generally speaking getting lot of speeds out of dixie is very difficult because complex shifting mechanisms tend need some form of slack in order function well. if you built up modern depailler bike but intentionally seized the freewheel the cassette would yank the lower chain the moment you stopped putting forward torque the cranks which could have exciting effects like dropping the chain and/or ripping the rear depailler off the bike. if you simply want bike that does have big external sprocket clusters and tensioners internalgear hubs are option. my knowledge the only practical way build up multispeed fixedgear bike is use fixedgear internal hub and as far as know the most speeds available is i.e. the SturmeyArcher hub. im not super familiar with these mechanisms but they seem have reputation for sloppy function and fragility
