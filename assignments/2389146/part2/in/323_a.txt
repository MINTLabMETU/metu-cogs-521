depends what you do with your road bike. the handling will not the same no matter what you do. its very responsive so its hard take one hand off the bars and difficult if not ill-advised ride hands. ive found this interferes with my ability make hand signals and do unlike stretches. the ride will rougher than typical road bike unless you do something smooth it out e.g. use plush tires which will have minor impact your overall speed. im definitely not enjoying the ride quality with psi Marathon Slicks. unless you put double front chairing or something funky like SRAM DualDrive your bike your gearing range with just single front chairing will smaller than standard road bike. however find the single front is good compromise between simplicity and gearing. personally find all this makes the bike poorly suited for fast group rides and maybe centuries and good for almost everything else
