gpsblake has very valid point. road bikes have been optimized reduce aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance. the you can go mph road bike but cant do the same speed mountain bike is because the road bike is easier get up that speed. push mountain bike up that speed they do much more than mph the road and you are working far harder than road bike. essentially you have work harder i.e. burn more calories per hour push mountain bike faster. the problem here is that it easier ride road bike further because the road bike is easier move down the road. do long ride road bike then do the same long ride mountain bike with hobbies. you can go faster the road bike which means less time and less energy burned than you can mountain bike
