hi James is right. the Bike fridays pivot point is behind the bottom bracket so two things happen. the distance between the crank set and rear hub changes as you fold the bike. it gets shorter so the chain tends drop off unless the depailler can death the slack. the front depailler doesnt move so the chain tends catch the bottom of the front depailler cage and pull it out of place. this is exacerbated because the pivot is also angled so the rear trianglerear wheel folds up one side of the top tube. this causes the chain exert sideways force the cogs cranks and derailleurs unless your very very careful about the set up before the fold. the perfect chain line in the unfolded position is angled in the folded position. the front depailler is often the most affected a and the chain tends fall off the chain rings as well. the Swift has what was described as unified rear triangle art earlymodel full suspension mountain bikes. the old Klein Mantra is the best example although there were several others a Trek bikes for example. with these bikes the relationship between the front crank seafront depailler and the rear huber depailler chain line and chain length remained constant as the rear triangle moved. the Swift adopts this principle and takes it extreme. the bottom bracket and front depailler if fitted is part of the folding rear triangle and so the bottom bracket dropout distance never changes. also the pivot point is not angled so when you fold the Swift not only does the rear trianglerear wheel fold directly under the top tube but also The distance between the crank set and rear hub remains constant as you fold the bike. the front depailler moves with the fold so the chain doesnt do anything the derailleurs because the chain length and chain line dont change from the unfolded position. theres good article about the difference between Bike and Swifts here and ask Bike owner with front depailler fold their bike so you can see what happens for yourself. the Air not suffer from this problem the same extent
