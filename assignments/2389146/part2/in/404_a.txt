pm Thanks for the link. so it says have get x as replacement for the original. however dont have get longer BB for dual chairing. or am mistaken about that. as for the carbon crank you raise good point about it being scratched. but its just sitting around right now as well put it good use. and given what Ive read about the DT plus the changes plan make well riding it lot. im primarily roadie so my DT wont see too many dirt trails. the derailleurs over the top but it is still ways from the DT owner that put durance her bike. wow. am planning change the saddle pedals and tires my bike when it finally arrives. think those are easy and high impact changes make the bike faster. very interesting read that you were pleased with just rebuilding the original wheels. ill have look carefully mine. thanks
