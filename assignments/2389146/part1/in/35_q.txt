... like a guy that came into their shop for a commuting bike, they showed him a nice flat-bar bike with rack and fenders. Guy says he'll sleep on it and come back. Well, he shows up a few days later with a full-suspension DH bike he'd bought from another LBS. This guy 'loved' the bike, but wanted full-fenders... SMH, nope, you were sold the wrong bike and you will not be able to mount full-fenders.
