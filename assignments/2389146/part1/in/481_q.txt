I'm "late" to this thread. I recently test-rode a birdy (Urban Bike Fitters in Fremont, California) and was impressed by the smooth ride over somewhat rough pavement. I'm seriously considering buying one. Before I commit, I'd appreciate comments anyone might have with respect to experience with the Rolloff model...
