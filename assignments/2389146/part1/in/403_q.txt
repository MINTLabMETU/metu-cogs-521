I'm working on lightening up the NS. The Marathon Racers and MKS pedals took off a pound and a half. The saddle weights 1.1 Kg, so swapping that for a $20 200gm saddle from Pricepoint took two pounds off. However, the lighter saddle and the lack of suspension was too much for me. Does anyone recommend a super comfy but relatively light saddle? I know that they are personal, but you have to start somewhere!
