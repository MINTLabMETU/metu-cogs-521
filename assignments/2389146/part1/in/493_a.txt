Would any competent local bike shop be able to fix anything on the bike?  Also are some parts really that hard to find including 18 inch wheels?  That's the only thing keeping me from buying a Birdy.  Having a hard time fixing the bike and end up with a useless bike or a bike that would take a long time to fix due to waiting for parts to arrive and or LBS not being able to fix it.
