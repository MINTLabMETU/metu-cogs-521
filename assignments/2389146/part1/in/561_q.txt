Got mine and threw it together. My dropper post won't come back up on it's own. I've played around with the cable tension and that didn't do anything nor is the seatpost clamp super tight. Is there something else I should do? This is my first dropper post.

I am surprised by how light the wheels/tires are. Didn't weigh them but they're surprisingly light, I was expecting them to be heavy as hell.
