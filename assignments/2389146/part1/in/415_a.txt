I don't know if you can change the DT stem from from the 20" to the but I put a Dahon 1 1/8 Quill Extender Stem (49.95) and Revolve Stem w/ Quick Release Top (19.25) on my Mini to get the adjustment I needed. The quick release top helps you get a flatter fold as well.

Here's a link to ThorUSA for the parts: 

The Mini has the 23T sprocket as does the VIIIH. See this thread for an in depth review of the SA hub and gearing on the VIIIH: 

You will likely find the gearing on the Mini is fine with the SA 8 speed hub. I also have the VIIIH 20" and the SA hub gears are too tall on this bike. You will want to change to the 25 tooth rear sprocket and may want to down size the front as well. Wavshrdr does a better job of explaining this and making recommendations than I can.

Good luck. Let us know what you decide to do on the gears and how it turns out.
