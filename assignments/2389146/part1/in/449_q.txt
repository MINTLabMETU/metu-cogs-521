SesameCrunch - one of the reasons modern bikes shift well is they have teeth on the cogs and chainrings that have been cut down to make it easy for the chain to come off for faster shifts under power.  A side effect is that on a bike with no front derailleur you have a natural spot for the chain to fall off.  You also have a 9-speed cassette which both means a wide side-to-side flex in the chain as you go from one extreme to the other.  Cures include keeping chain tension fairly high by making your chain no longer than it needs to be, but the dummy front derailler or plastic roller (modify a skate wheel if you're cheap) work the best.  You really don't want the chain falling off at even moderate speeds.  You could try and find an older chainring without the pins and ramps of modern ones, but it would be a bit wide for the nine speed chain.

The plastic and metal rings that can be bolted to your chainring don't always keep the chain from falling off.  They do keep it from falling off the crankset and keep the loose chain from going into your back wheel, but you may just wedge your chain between the ring and the guard. That is why the derailleur approach tends to work better.

I like your modifications and will be making similar ones soon when my VIIH gets here.  It will be my first new folder in about 30 years!  Last one died after damage to the crank and chainring by the airlines...
