Huh, why are you declaring 29/27.5+ bikes to be a sign of 29ers taking over 27.5+ territory and not the other way around? Sorry, but that just does not hold water. Plus size has decreased in numbers and popularity from a few years ago, but is clearly NOT going away at this point. Which throws water on your assertion that since you see less of something that it is a sign of going away completely.
