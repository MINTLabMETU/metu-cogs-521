hi SesameCrunch, sorry to report that i never found out what caused it - it just stopped doing it, which is great but i don't know why. i actually seem to have some wobble in the chain ring which i guess maybe related, i plan to have this sorted out soon.

i commute 12 miles a day and it would happen 2/3 times a day, then it just stopped.

sorry i can't be much help, maybe your problem will disappear too.
