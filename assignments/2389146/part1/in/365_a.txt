Two years is NOT weird if youre starting a new tech bike company from scratch.

From what it seems now, the BIGGEST problem holding Helix back is that they are dependent on contractors for making certain proprietary parts. Thats supposedly what is delaying the test bike (and backer bikes) now. Hopefully in the near future, ALL frame parts will be manufactured in-house. 

No one will have a problem if stuff like wheels, spokes, tubes, brakes, derailleurs, etc. are imported. However, Im all for getting frame-sets anyways. I can get my own components.
