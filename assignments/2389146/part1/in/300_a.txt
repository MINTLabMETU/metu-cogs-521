Hi James and other Swifties

Peter Reich told me about this forum long after I'd ordered a frameset from him.  I'd wanted a folder frameset to build up a folding touring bike and no other manufacturer  (Bike Friday, Moulton, Dahon, PBW etc) would sell me just the frameset.  So about this time a year ago, I ordered an unpainted frameset from Peter and assembled the bike - after frame mods - over the Aussie winter.  I enjoyed putting it together so here's the history.

A local company down here  GripSport  specialises in frame repairs and welding dropouts to frames with no disk brake tabs. Jon Weaving undertook to weld disk brake tabs onto the fork and rear dropout/seat stay to the IS 2000 disk brake mounting standard. He also powder coated the frame in my choice of colour.

Besides the disk brake tabs, I added a 4" after market quill extender. I could have used a stem with an acute rise but I prefer a flat [little rise] stem  especially with drop bars.  I have long legs but an average torso so I needed the handlebars to be higher tham I could achieve with the normal riser.

I had hoped to use a bar end shifter to change the internal 3 speed hub gears but it was too difficult to get the shifting right so I used SRAMs 3 speed twist shifter attached to the drop bar using a HubBub twist shift adaptor.

Using the 3 speed hub, road cluster and 20" tyres, I have a gear range of 105 to 22 gear inches, which is ideal as far as Im concerned. It would be worthwhile replacing the cable guide under the top tube with a model that handles three (rather than two) cables. Cable ties are a wonderful thing though, for the rest of the cable routing.

The bike rides a treat; steering is a little quicker than my full size bike and the disk brakes are fabulous. Next time Im bombing down 17+ km of twisty mountain road with a 9  11 per cent grades, I wont be thinking about overheated rims and tyres blowing off. The full specifications for the bike are shown below if youre interested in the detail.

I've been trying to attach some other photos, but the file size is too big.  When I find out how to make the images smaller, I'll post them on the forum.  I logged ont this forum today for the first time and I wish I'd done it a long time ago; may have saved me some heartache .  It's been a great read and I hope it continues.  Sorry it's taken so long to get the details to the thread.
