Hi guys, got a question about the birdy that need some help here. The lever that is used to lock the stem upright keeps undoing itself. It seems each time after barely 10 mins of cycling the lever is halfway up. I have to constantly remind myself to push it down or find something to hold it in position. 
Is there a way to fix it? Thanks!
