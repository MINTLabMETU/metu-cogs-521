That lever operates an eccentric cam. The position of the cam is determined by 2 small set screws that tighten the lever to the cam axle. If the lever is pushed all the way down, the cam has to be just past its maximum point or it will simply undo itself. So loosen the 2 set screws and set the lever position further back so it will push the cam further. Make sure you get it right, it's a safety critical assembly.

I don't have any pics, sold my Birdy.
