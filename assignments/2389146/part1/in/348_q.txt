Did you get Peter’s permission to post those photos?  

Peter already stated months ago that internal cable routing was too hard, hence all cable routing will be external. 

You’re right though: shifter cable seems missing. Possibly  because it's the single speed model? But then why have that tensioner  there...unless it's required to keep the chain from hanging loose in the  folded position.
