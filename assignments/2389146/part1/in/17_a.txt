Those links don't seem to work anymore. Anyway, I wouldn't buy a new $250 road bike with a triple - you're bound to have problems with it and won't feel like riding it. My friend bought a cheap bike like that, the thing never shifted properly, and is now gathering dust outside his home - he wouldn't even ride it to the store. A good used bike would be much better imho, but one thing you have to make sure is fit. A medium should be a good fit for you in most brands.
