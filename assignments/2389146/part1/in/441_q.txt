My Mini is in the hospital.   

The bottom bracket was so stuck I couldn't budge it with an 18" breaking bar or an impact driver - this after letting it soak in liquid wrench (applied from both sides) for about an hour.  Hopefully, the LBS will be able to get it out without damaging the frame.

I hope to get it back this evening so I'll let you know how it turns out.
