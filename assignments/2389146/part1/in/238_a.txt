I agree with you completely. I'm a resourcefulness  (I got this laptop from the garbage ) and it irks me to have a bunch of old brakes lying around that would work fine if it weren't for a single badly designed part. The new brakes that Shimano makes to replace them are great but why buy new what you can fix? If I ever figure out a good solution I'll post it here as this thread will most certainly still exist.
