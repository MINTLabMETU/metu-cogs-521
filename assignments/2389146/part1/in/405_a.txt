That's exactly what I needed to know.  I think I will do the 108 length because I will be in the large ring mostly.  I will see how it goes without the FD.  If it's too troublesome to shift manually, I can always install later.  Thanks much.  

I really like what you did with your bike, by the way.  Nice wrenching!!!
