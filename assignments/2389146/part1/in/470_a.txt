I had a chance to ride the non-Rohloff version in Berlin last summer, and I found it to be very responsive, even lively. 

I decided to stay with my Giant Expressway folder, which I retrofitted with a chain-based Rohloff. I absolutely ADORE my hub. I've had zero problems with it, it is easy to shift when moving or stopped, and it just works.

Some gears are a little louder than others, which does serve to help you know which gear it is in. You also have to just slightly back off the pressure when shifting, but you don't have to stop the pedals. But the 14 linearly-spaced gears are just a joy to ride.

I'd recommend testing the birdy and if you like the general ride I'd definitely recommend the Rohloff.
