I wasn't riding fixed back then, but yeah, if you're serious about keeping up with the roadies, you gotta have drops. My riser bars at 50cm wide are terrible aerodynamic-wise, but are more practical for fixed-gear city riding where the upright position and more leverage make the bike more responsive when darting in and out of traffic. They also have a nice sweep back that make them very comfortable on the wrists. I'm never going back to flat bars!
