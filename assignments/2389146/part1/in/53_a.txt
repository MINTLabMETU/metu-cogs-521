I was going to upgrade my genII hayabusa to a BMW S1000-RR.  It's a better bike handling wise, all wise really.  I had the money saved, went down and climbed on the bike but found it too cramped for the sort of long distance trips I like to do and the gear I carry.  Oh well, away I walked, no sense in buying something for it's image alone.  It has to comfortably do the job you intend it for.

Here is a MTB, A Talon-1.  Great for rough trails but not too flash on the road, though I do ride it on-road to the bush tracks then let some air out of the tires.  The pedals have been changed now.




Here is another MTB, absolutely not set up for rough trails.
