Strangely, this rack does not have the threaded hole to bolt on the rolling wheels.  I have since drilled and cut M5 thread into it and now it has the small wheels from the Brompton rack 

I'm waiting for the carbon seat post and sport handlebar post to arrive, so they will go on next.  Sadly my spare 20" wheels did not fit due to the tyres on it.  Looks like you'll have to run skinny Kojaks to be able to fit.  Shelf that idea for now.  Deciding if I should get some mudguards.
