Same distance at similar intensity, sure, you'll burn more calories on the bike that makes the exercise take longer. That's not how people tend to plan rides, though; if I'm on a faster bike, and intend a similar sort of workout, I'll likely go faster and farther.

If anything, riding like-for-like roads, I'm more likely to get a good workout on the road bike since I'll have the happy incentive of greater sense of speed and seeing more things.
If trail riding gets thrown into the mix, things get more complicated.
