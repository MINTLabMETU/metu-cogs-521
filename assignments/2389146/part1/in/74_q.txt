Don't read the thread. If you do, you will see what else that poster has said ...  and as you can probably imagine based on that one post ...  you don't really want to know.

As I said a ways back in this thread, I don't care if you ride a tricycle, a unicycle, a bent, an MTB (free-ride, race, downhill, XC, F/S or hardtail,) a CX, a BMX, or a TT, or any other variety of pavement oriented bike, with drop bars, rando bars, flat bars, swept bars ...  I don't care. I like riding bikes. I hope everyone who rides bikes likes riding bikes, but I don't care. I hope that people who want to ride bikes, get bikes and ride them, but I don't care.

I like riding bikes. Others' mileage may vary. That's the world.

This whole thread got stupid in a hurry.

My favorite color is faster than yours.
