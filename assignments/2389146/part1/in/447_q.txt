One thing at the pictures of all bikes that stops me from buying is the fender size and mounting. The rear one is too short... ...The good thing about suspension front fork is that it has v-brake and disk mounts at the same time so I can install disc brakes for winter but from the pictures it does not have fender mounts at all.
