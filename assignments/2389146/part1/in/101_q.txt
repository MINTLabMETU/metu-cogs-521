I think that most people who ride bikes aren't cycling enthusiasts like those of us who hang out on this forum.  They ride short distances for transportation or fun/exercise.  They area afraid to ride on roads.  They stay on paved trails and sidewalks.  Even the term "road bike" is scary to them.    It does take a couple of years of consistent riding on technical terrain to pick up the skills.
