I agree that the Swift is more responsive, but I'm able to comfortably ride mine no-handed, and I'm not an especially acrobatic cyclist.  While I haven't ridden it on a century yet (though I intend to), I've done a couple of 50 mile rides, and found it comfortable enough.  I too am using narrow high pressure tires (Stelvio 1.125" @ 90 psi), but I will put on something wider (Marathon Racers?) when they wear out, in the interest of more comfort, and perhaps a somewhat less responsive front end.

I don't do many group rides on mine, but that's because it's a fixed gear, which brings its own issues when riding with others.

I'm not really disagreeing with Bacciagalupe--the Swift will not behave the same as a 700c road bike.  But the differences are surprisingly minor, to me at least.
