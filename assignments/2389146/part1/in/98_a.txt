This is "General Cycling" which means there are as many reasons for riding a bike as there are people posting here.  People ride for transportation, fitness, fun, stubbornness, etc.  To say "I laugh at all those people on bicycles thinking they're even getting a work out" is to imply that bicycling  be used for exercise.  

While whether or not a person is "getting a work out" obviously on the level of intensity, most people ride for at least some level of exercise.  Some of us even try to do multiply things on our bikes like use it for transportation  using it for fitness  using it for fun  sometimes just for a ride.  None of those activities implies that the others can't happen.
