I only flew with my Birdy once, and I borrowed a friend's Bike Friday suitcase to do it. It was a hard-side Samsonite, around 30" IIRC. There was a lot of room for the bike, but I had to remove both wheels and on my particular model the stem was not adjustable so I had to take the handlebars off. All in all, not too much trouble to pack it, though my Brompton has it beat (no packing required - fold and put in case!)
