Yeah, it could be dubious that the piccie has some Photoshope-ing going on.

So how about a non-pro photo? NO paper and inappropriate lighting might result with the same reaction. "Dear Peter, there might be some doubt that the test bike is real. In two weeks, would you be a love and switch the light on for the next test bike photo?"

One POSITIVE 'to what end' fabrication is that we'd all have our bikes right now!
