I have just got my VIII H with the suspension fork.  It does have a small hole in the dropout that would allow you to mount a front fender brace if you wanted to.

You could move the rear fender to the front... I would guess it would be a good fit, and they you could get a clip-on Freddy Fender or other rear fender, all for about $10-$15.

One real advantage of the short rear fender which I have not seen mentioned is that the lack of fenders makes it easy to roll the bike around when folded.  I use a velcro strap to fasten the fork crown to the rear rack.  With the stem folded down between the two wheels and the handlebars strapped to the top tube, the bike rolls nicely while using the seat as a handle.  I will try and post a picture later.  If you had full-length fenders the bike could not be rotated back far enought to let it roll on its wheels.  The rolling position has the frame hinge directly above the bottom bracket.  The bike is then balanced and rolls easily.  The only minor problem is I replaced the folding pedals with SPDs and the left pedal rubs a little on the front tire while in this position.
