You can't use Walmart as a basis of comparison for killing the 26" wheel bikes. Those are just bike shaped objects that kids ride around on the pavement.

And if you noticed 27.5 is dying off the most of the big name manufactures websites. Giant is realizing that going all in on 27.5 wheel size was a big mistake. Now look what happened. All of their models available in 29 now. It wasn't that long ago that you couldn't find a 29er on the Giant website.
