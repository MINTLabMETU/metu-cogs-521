The problem is not whether the bars will fit the bike. The problems are:
1. Putting drop bars on a flat-bar bike will change the reach - the distance from saddle to bars. So the bike may no longer fit you with drop bars installed
2. The brake levers will need replacing, and so will the gear shifters. 

All things considered, if you want a drop bar road bike, you'd do much better to buy one
