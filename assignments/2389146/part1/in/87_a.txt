Moving along at 10mph?-So what?

Here is a thought for ya - not everybody on a bike on the road is in "training" mode! Or wants to be in "training" mode, or gives a poop about ever being in "training" mode. Some bicyclists just like to ride their bikes to get somewhere at their own pace and/or for enjoyment, and not as a workout, fitness drill or speed contest.

Some bicyclists often use a bike they deem suitable for their activity, which may not match what you would choose - So What?
