 ... I guess I was trying to see if the swift would compare to a Bike Friday.  Where all I read and hear about those bikes, is how awesome they are. And how they can easily replace someones true road bike... fixie ... the contact person @ BF advised against it, and said its not practical and would be difficult to do ...  to have a sweet folding bike that would be able ride with the big boys if needed... I don't know anything about braze on front derailers, but is that even a consideration to get a FD onto the swift?
