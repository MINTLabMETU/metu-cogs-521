Zepi, you beat me to the punch. That is exactly what I am using and is a very inexpensive part. BTW, for anyone with a similar problem, many different companies make one...you can get a pyramid or other inexpensive brand derailler hanger and it will work exactly the same as one from a bigger name, ie. more expensive, company. If you want a derailler, that'll work fine.
