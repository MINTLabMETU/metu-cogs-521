I recall, say 10+ years ago, when the 96er was a favored hybrid adopted by some in the fringe and panned by the vast majority.
(IMO, perhaps cuz I'm old) likely I have no immediate nor long term plans to buy another mtb frame since I'm very satisfied with my present gear for my use....tho perhaps buy into a 1X16 in a decade (LOL).
