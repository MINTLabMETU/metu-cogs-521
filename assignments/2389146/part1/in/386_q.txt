This is my wifes custom Seven that was built around 24 inch wheels so it meets one of your wants and will also pack in a suit case.  About 16 pounds in weight with a Shimano drive train.  Do you have $5500 to spare.  If so you to can have one.  Total production time from first drawing to delivery was less than 3 months and currently has about 7,000 miles on it.  Roger
