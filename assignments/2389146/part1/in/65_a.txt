Can the same road bike ride city traffic through debris without flats, time trial, randonneur, and take on MUPs "well"?

I think no. Arguing over which bike does what well is silly, because each of us are going to tailor a bike for what we do specifically.  I know personally, if I were to pick just one bike, it would be a slick tired MTB/hybrid, because it can do everything I would want it to do halfway well.  Thankfully, I don't have to pick just one.
