Thanks for your ideas...
I'm not sure if I get your extra-steps though. Austrias trains are far from being escorted by grim MPs, even if the conductors are a little beefy sometimes. But I guess they are like that everywhere... 
Slightly off topic: I recently saw an excellent movie about uncanny train-rides that perfectly reflects the  of European trains. "" from the danish director: Lars von Trier. See this movie, if you get the chance. It is outstanding! (but it is different in reality)

Anyways, the posting gave me the idea to modify an old, worn out , that looks wonderfully used. I think it even has patched bullet-holes . It might fit well and would be very stylish... I'll post some images as soon as I got my bike in there...
