The bike has only been wet from dew a couple of times - never rode it in the rain nor has it had any salt spray on it.  It's normally very dry here so we don't have salt corrosion problems like they do in Florida where it's humid most of the time.  So, yes, I live near the water, but no, I don't think that was a factor - maybe I'm wrong.

The bike is only a couple of months old and I figure I've put about 60 miles on it.  The BB started making noise last weekend - creaking.  

The LBS called to say that it's done so they must have gotten it out ok.  I'll report what they tell me when I pick it up this evening.
