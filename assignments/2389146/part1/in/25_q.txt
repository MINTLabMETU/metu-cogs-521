Hi, just bought my first road bike. It's a very entry level bike as I don't have any clue about parts or brands when I bought it. I did some reading here and other references and know a little more than what I know a month back. I'm looking to do some upgrades on my bike (planning to join a Sprint Tri in November).

Brake calipers are generic or at least not a really known brand. Is it a good upgrade (planning to move to a Tiagra set of calipers)?

F/R hubs are Fastace but I would also want to upgrade it to a Tiagra (a local merchant is selling me a set of calipers and the hubs). Question on this, the Fastace has 24 holes and the Tiagra I think has 32. Will I need to change my rim set as well? Or I'd be able to use my existing rim set?  

Thanks.
