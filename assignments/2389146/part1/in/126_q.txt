Hello from Germany. Yesterday my Tern Vektron P9 broke down. Fortunately not during the drive but when starting at a traffic light. I bought it on november 15th last year. I am curious what my dealer will say on the phone afterwards. 2 minutes before I stood at the traffic light, the tachometer indicated still good 40km/h (it went downhill) not to imagine what could have happened. maybe I should start to pray ;-) unfortunately I can only post after 10 posts photos or left on pictures :-/ it looks exactly the same as with tds, exactly the same place.
