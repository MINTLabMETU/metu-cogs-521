27.5+ is defined as 2.8 to 3.0

Specialized's number one selling mountain bike (StumpJumper) Is only offered as 27.5 or  29er  with 27.5+ combatibility.  Their 27.5+ offerings are an e-bike, a hardtail and one enduro downhill bike.  But otherwise they have a mix of 27.5 and 29

Trek doesn't have any 27.5+  bikes right now.  They switch between 27.5 and 29 depending on bike size.

Giant has one 27.5+ offering which is the XTC Advanceda and mix of 27.5 and 29


I don't think 27.5+ will be phased out. Too many benefits. Almost same diameter as 29 and better traction.

However, I do feel 27.5 will be phased out in the near future. We can just agree to disagree on that.
