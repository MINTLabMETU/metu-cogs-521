What? Those adapters donâ€™t work on 135 QR hubs.

Maybe we are answering different questions here. Someone asked if it was possible to convert 135mm hub to Boost (148x12).

The answer is yes.... IF the hub itself is convertible (and many mid-high end hubs are).

However, if not (such as with many shimano hubs), there are no aftermarket end cap adapters (that I know of) that will let you stick a 135 QR hub in a boost frame spacing. The ones you linked to do not do that.
