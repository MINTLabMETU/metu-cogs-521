It really is a dream bike. You'll have the last laugh when you go for coffee and bring your bike in the shop. I sold my Kryptonite along with my full size bike. Let's see...20 pound bike plus 20 pound chain or a  20 pound bike and no chain, hmmm. The kicker is that the world speed record on an upright was set on a 20" bike. The frame is nice and stiff, no redundencies, and it's light.

Yes, I would shoot for my own solution to the chainguard thing. The stock one at Performance bike is outrageously priced and is 70 grams. The 105 chainring that I have on my Birdy has holes drilled in it that would allow one to be mounted. 
Dahon puts a little plastic thingy on the seatpost that approximates the ring on the inside and a chainring on the outside. I'll take a picture when I get a chance, and post it along with my improvised ring.

Garlean puts a big funky looking orange roller over the chainring on his bikes (.

Finally, you can see if the plastic rings from your defunct cranks fit into the drillouts in the FSA chainring (are those drillouts?). The chainring on your wife's bike is just like the one I have on my NS.
