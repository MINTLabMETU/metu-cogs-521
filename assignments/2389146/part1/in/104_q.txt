I worked in bike stores before and during the arrival of mountain bikes. Nobody working in shops at the time was pushing mountain bikes for casual riders---we all took for granted that everyone should be on a road bike and that the only riders who needed a mountain bike were the few people doing hard-core off-road riding.

But casual riders who tried mountain bikes took to them immediately. They liked the upright riding position, the stable handling, the comfortable saddle, and the ease and security of shifting gears without moving their hands away from the handlebars.

Result: road bikes went from being 90% of the adult bike market to 5%, which tracks nicely with the proportions of the numbers of racers versus casual riders. The main difference is that hybrids have taken over much of the market slices formerly taken by mountain bikes and road bikes. But the mountain bike is still a perfectly reasonable choice for the casual rider.
