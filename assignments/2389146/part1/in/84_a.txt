Correct.  One would think if riding mountain bikes on roads were such a great training tool, you would see more racers, and riders in general using them for that purpose.  And yet, most of the mountain bikers I see on roads (as opposed to trails) are moving along at 10 mph or slower.  The real mountain bikers leave their mountain bikes at home in favor of road bikes when they train on the road.
