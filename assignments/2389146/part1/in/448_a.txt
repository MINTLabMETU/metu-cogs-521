Yes Downtube has some internally geared models but it is the combination of the internal gears replacing the front derailleur and double or triple chainrings AND an 8sp/9sp rear cassette that would give you a 24/27sp gearing with low gears in the mid/high teens and high gears over 100" and. You simply cannot have that kind of range on a 20" wheel any other way and IMO if one is not going to get that kind of total capacity out of a front derailleur project then the stock setup with wide range rear cluster and 48T front ring need not be messed with. The 8sp and 14sp internal hubs offer decent range and gear spacing but cost is an issue. Weight too. I am not sure that the SRAM hub at $200 is terribly more expensive than obtaining a modern FD, chainwheel(s), shifter. The Sturmey-Archer hub is cheaper but fitting a 9sp cassette onto it would be tricky. The SRAM hub is built exactly for that purpose.
