+1, you beat me too it.  Even  cheap, Wally World V brake levers will allow for proper clearance and good braking pressure, that's one of the advantages of V's.  Sounds like someone put canti levers on cause that's exactly how they would act.
Turky Lurkey, there is a measurement you can make to determine which type of lever you've got.  I used to know it by heart, but can't remember now.
