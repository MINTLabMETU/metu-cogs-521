Depends on what you do with your road bike.

The handling will not be the same, no matter what you do.  It's very responsive, so it's hard to take one hand off the bars, and difficult (if not ill-advised) to ride no-hands.  I've found this interferes with my ability to make hand signals and do on-bike stretches.

The ride will be rougher than a typical road bike, unless you do something to smooth it out (e.g. use plush tires) -- which will have a (minor) impact on your overall speed.  I'm definitely not enjoying the ride quality with 100psi Marathon Slicks.

Unless you put a double front chainring or something funky like a SRAM DualDrive on your bike, your gearing range with just a single front chainring will be smaller than a standard road bike.  However, I find the single front is a good compromise between simplicity and gearing.

Personally I find all this makes the bike poorly suited for fast group rides and maybe centuries, and good for almost everything else.
