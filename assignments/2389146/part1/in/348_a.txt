Every one of those photos (except for the test bike photo) can be found through Google Images, or even can be found on the Helix website without login. For the test bike, yeah - I apologize to Peter for sharing that. I went into witch hunt mode - I still am. I'm still up in the air about the need for a studio-like test bike. More realistic would've been a test bike with a few grease spots on it, attached to a work stand, with a half-eaten sandwich and some empty beer bottles on the work bench.   

You may be right. After further viewing of the test bike pic, the appearance is that of a single rear gear. Tensioning required.

I still have my suspicions. It might just very well be my own little world with my own made up demons.
