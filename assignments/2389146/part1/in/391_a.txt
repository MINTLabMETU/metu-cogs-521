24" wheels are much better on uneven terrain (especially cobble stones) than 20" wheels as I can tell from experience with my Airnimal Joey and various 20" folders. There is the Schwalbe Kojak in 507 which I would consider a sufficient road tire - the Helix (as most folders) is is my opinion not a "high performance road bike" anyway. 

Regarding the vello: I've ridden a prototype a while ago and while it was ok neither the ride nor the design have impressed me too deeply. Obviously YMMV - a matter of taste. The vello has suffered from massive delays as well and while they claim they would start delivery in a couple of weeks (early February) chances also seem never to have been better to succeed for the Helix as well now, that they finally have a test bike. Personally I find the Helix far more interesting than the vello, but again YMMV.
