No.  Not correct.  The faster you go, the harder you work.  It isn't so much miles, as calories burned per hour ridden.  A machine that allows you to ride efficiently is faster, which will increase aerodynamic drag by orders of magnitude, which the cyclist will have to work harder to overcome  

A road cyclist moving along at 16 or 18 mph is working orders of magnitude harder than a the same cyclist riding a mountain bike at 10 mph.  And the fast moving road cyclists will ride much further in the same period of time, getting a better workout. Same distance at similar intensity, sure, you'll burn more calories on the bike that makes the exercise take longer. That's not how people tend to plan rides, though; if I'm on a faster bike, and intend a similar sort of workout, I'll likely go faster and farther.
