Way more.  I love being able to turn off the hardtop onto a footpath before busy intersections, rumble through the grass and then jump the curb around the corner and continue on my way.  Or simply stay on the sidewalk navigating concrete, bumpy dirt or long grass.  Often the best choice on a very busy section of road and a nice diversion after miles of speeding through the back roads.  I have never seen anyone on a racer do it.  Many claim they can, but I have seen it in the real world
