So many closed minds, so many assumptions ...

I am not fit enough to ride my MTB on a real MTB trail ... and I don't see the point of riding it anywhere else, when I have other bikes which ride better everywhere else. That is---I have more FUN riding those other bikes on those other surfaces. 

When people say "bike type X is more fun" they are pretty much being idiots. it's one of those "My favorite color is the Best color" arguments. Purely subjective, and some people are so locked into their own brains they cannot seem to imagine that anyone else could differ. I don't know what to say to such folk.


is riding a mountian bike More fun? Well ...  that would be purely subjective, wouldn't it?

I can say ..  Most of the peple I see riding low-cost MTBs are Not hopping curbs, Not riding down stairs, Not crossing grass, and Not riding trails. There are mostly riding for transport/utility, and not a lot of them look like they are filled with joy to be riding.

the people I see riding MTBs on the trials all seem to be having outrageously good times, even when they are visibly suffering. 

.  Really, people, is critical thinking and self-examination completely dead to some folks?

My favorite color is better than yours. Much better ...  because it is more fun.
