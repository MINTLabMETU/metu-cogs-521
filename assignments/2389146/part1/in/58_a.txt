Okay ...  i had assumed that was sarcasm, and he was really supporting MTBs ...  I guess I missed that one totally.

I wonder if for the pros it is different ... watching them on TV they seem Never to slow down ...  but for me MTB riding is as you describe it, short bursts of effort followed by (hopefully) enough recovery to tackle the next section.

Only downside to MTBs (IMO) is that it is hard to take a relaxed MTB ride ... I guess i could ride the jeep trails, but that is just road biking on packed dirt .... I feel I need a certain level of whole-body fitness to tackle the real trails.

It's only a downside because I lost all that fitness, and it is coming back too slowly ....
