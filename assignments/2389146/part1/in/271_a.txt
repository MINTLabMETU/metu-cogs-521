They're the Nashbar TT bars for $12.45. Plug-in a coupon from the Coupons forum for even more joy. 

Just a few notes: the bar tops have a drop mid-way in the bar, which looks cool, but doesn't make for a comfortable on-the-tops riding position (unless you don't mind riding with your hands close together alongside the stem). The bar is standard 26.0, so BMX levers may not fit (perhaps unless you have hinged mounts). Other than that, bullhorns provide lots of leverage for out-of-the-saddle efforts, and better low-speed balance and control (still learning how to do a trackstand  ). If you do go with bullhorns, angle the bars upwards to match the angle of your wrists when you are in your seated riding position.
