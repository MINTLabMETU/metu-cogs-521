Cross country, downhill, enduro, singletrack and I'm sure there are a few more in which it excels. If it was not capable of doing anything well I'm sure the community, designers, technicians and teams would be looking at road bikes to descend a double black diamond. But, they haven't, they use mountain bikes, which do it very well.
