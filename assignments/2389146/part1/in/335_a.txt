Indeed, I am astounded by all the hurray after the single bike got produced.  There are so many things that need to line up to make a good bike .  On the other hand the audience has an abnormally large component of those who jumped in the first place, so certainly not typical.  Even though there are so many bikes in the world that are long in production, but are duds for one reason or another, good luck there!
