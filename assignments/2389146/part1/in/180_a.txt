Because you said by my logic plus sized bikes would be phased out. They kinda are and manufacturers have moved to making their bikes 27.5+ compatible while selling it as a 29er. Leaves the option in the consumers hands of getting a wheelset if they want to.


Someone probably said the same thing about 26" bikes. And where they are now?

IMO...27.5 will be a thing of the past within the next 2-5 years. Just an educated guess knowing how things work in the bike industry.
