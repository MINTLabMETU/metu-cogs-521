Morgan, thanks for suggestions. As a budget minded I would not buy the cable stop for 15 bucks  . I have a lot of components from the old 10 speed bikes (I hope I have the cable stops also), so I just needed to know if it is possible to attach the FD to this bike in a proper position.

Maunakea, thanks for the link.
