BigMac,

I have two DT's, a Mini and a VIIIH and I'm planning on taking them on a sailing adventure next year.  It sounds like I really need to do this mod as getting wet, perhaps even with salt water is a given.  

So which BB and crank set did you end up with and how much did they cost?

Do you think this is something the average person could change out on their own or do we need to take it to the LBS?  My bikes are only a couple of months old and haven't been ridden in the rain or gotten wet at all.

Thanks.
