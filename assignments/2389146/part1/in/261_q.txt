Check for chain stretch, but before you do, check to make sure your rear hub hasn't slid forward in the track ends Also, what kind of chain do you have (8sp or single?). I've stretched through a PC-68 chain on my SS pretty quickly. I find that BMX chains are much more durable and are far less prone to drop than multi-speed chains.
