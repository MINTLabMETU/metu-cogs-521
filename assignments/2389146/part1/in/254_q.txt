I got these TRP miniVs after reading about them on a bike touring forum somewhere. Too lazy to pull down the bike at the moment, but here's the fork. The pivot positions are pretty spot on. Like I've said plenty of power with these rims. Also remember rim quality also makes a difference. For cheap rime, consider Alex Adventure 2s. They perform nearly as well as my cliffhangers and TK540s for a fraction of cost. I'll snap more this weekend if you need better angles or close ups
