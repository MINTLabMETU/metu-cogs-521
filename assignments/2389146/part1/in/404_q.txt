Here is a thread to the bottom bracket forum: http://www.bikeforums.net/showthread...wntube+English. This is a fun bike to modify. Despite the fact that it has a hinge, the frame is stiff. Still, it's kind of funny modifying such a basic bike with high-end parts. 

This bike folds quickly, has a stiff frame, and rides very well if you tune up the stock parts. Much better than a Dahon. But it produces a large, heavy folded package that doesn't stay together without a bungee chord. If you shave 5 pounds from the bike, it will turn from a oversized heavy box to an oversized box (kind of like trying to carry an empty refridgerator carton). One arguement for expensive mods is that you can bring the components up to spec for a $600 Dahon and produce a better riding bike that also performs well on uneven pavement. 

Putting 105 level stuff on this bike is a bit over the top. Also, be careful if you actually do fold and walk around with this bike a lot. No matter how careful you are, you will bump it (or others will bump it), and scratched carbon cranks can be dangerous. That said, I feel like I'm being a spoil sport. Have fun with the mods, and keep us up to date!

I changed the tires and pedals, and am waiting to try the saddles recommended above. The best mod was rebuilding the wheels with the same hubs and rims. Having a steel ring crank seems a bit low-end, but it performs so well, I'm not in a hurry to change it. (Not sure what the cranks are costing in weight, but sure to be heavier than the TruVativ (sp) cranks on a mid-range Dahon.)
