I'm a pro mechanic and I've never totally got why some people are so into King. The bling is certainly fantastic, and I've never encountered a bad product of theirs, but their performance isn't amazingly exceptional. I like mid-end Cane Creek headsets--easy to find replacement bearings, great tolerances, sane price, versions for pretty much every possible headset standard. Really any kind of headset service is in most cases fairly infrequent and not particularly onerous--I don't get highly prioritizing long wear on this part. Their hubs are unique and I'll say that they do seem to have great service life (and as a wrench they're entertaining to service), but really there are a lot of really good options in the market that are lighter, have higher engagement, or both at lower prices. I would have a hard time choosing a very premium hub unless I had, like, an absolutely top tier groupset on the rest of the bike, name brand carbon rims, etc. I think part of their success is that they only make parts at the high end, and their products are highly visible and nearly never on stock builds. It's a way to say (or, depending on the anodization, scream) that you've got a slick, custom build.
