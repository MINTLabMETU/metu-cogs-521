Thanks for this detailed post. Today I was able to ride to one end of the trail which is about 14 miles (with some minimal head winds) and averaged 13.3 mph and did it in 1h 3m which is progress compared to my previous rides. On the ride back home (another 14 miles) I averaged 14.3 mph and did it in 58 minutes. I also noticed that I wasn't huffing and puffing nor did I feel the excruciating pain in my thighs like the last few rides. The awareness of my cadence really helped, I know for a fact I was pedaling at a waaaaay too slow cadence on my last few rides, because I didn't even know what cadence was LOL. For the first half of the ride typically I stayed in the middle cassette on the front, and gear 4-5 on the back (headwinds), and on the way back I stayed in the middle cassette on the front, and 5-6 on the back. 

As for shifting, I took your advice and didn't worry too much about major shifting for small dips and uphills. I did shift accordingly to keep my cadence high going uphill and it helped tremendously. 

For the first time today I actually felt like I made a tremendous improvement and I feel that if i keep at it I can only get better. Thanks a lot.
