As an update, I bought a Tiagra front derailleur off eBay and installed it to protect against chain drop.  I did not route/install cables for the FD, since I don't intend to shift with it.   I bought a double derailleur, but I should have gotten a triple.  It needed the wider cage.  I ended up just manually widening the cage so it could accommodate the entire 9 gears.  I'm hoping that will take care of the problem for good.  

Now all my planned modifications are complete.  I'm very happy with it.  It's a gorgeous bike (see pictures posted earlier).  Guess I'll have to go find another bike to tinker with, eh?
