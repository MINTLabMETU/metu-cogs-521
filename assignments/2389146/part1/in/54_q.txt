I thought I might like a classic hardtail mountain bike for more rustic rides, but I can count the times on one hand I have actually ridden my Trek 930 in the last two years.  But why?  I have wide, but smooth tires.  I suspect it is the riding position, combined with the flat bars, the heavy tires, and the 26" wheels.  The bike just feels sluggish.  There may eventually be a place I like to ride that is too rustic for my Salsa where I might find a hardtail mountain bike to be just the thing, but I haven't found it yet.
