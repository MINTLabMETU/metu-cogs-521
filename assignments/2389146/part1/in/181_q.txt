Because you said by my logic plus sized bikes would be phased out. They kinda are and manufacturers have moved to making their bikes 27.5+ compatible while selling it as a 29er. Leaves the option in the consumers hands of getting a wheelset if they want to. Someone probably said the same thing about 26" bikes. And where they are now?
