 Tern has always subcontracted their frames to a smorgasbord of welding houses.

This is not uncommon in the bicycle industry - most of the bikes in your LBS were fabricated by subcontractors, and untold millions of quality bikes fabricated by subcontractors are out there safely providing joy to their owners.

The key is to develop an ongoing relationship with a quality fabricator.

On the other hand, off the top of my head: BikeFriday builds their own stuff. Brompton builds their own stuff. Dahon builds their own stuff. Giant builds their own folders. Ming Cycle builds their Stridas in house. Pacific Cycle builds the Birdy, Reach, CarryMe and IF in their own factory.
