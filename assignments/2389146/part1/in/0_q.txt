Hey guys, I just bought my first road bike from my local shop, just waiting on it to come back with my fitted measurements. I just need help on shifting. I have the shimano all in one shifters/brakes. I know that the left controls the front and the right controls the back. however I don't know which lever puts it in what gear (ex. does the little shifter put it from a smaller cog to a bigger one?) I just don't know which direction the shifters put the gears in. any help would be great if you guys understand this.
