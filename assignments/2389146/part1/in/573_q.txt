Well, the nightmare has begun again. Noticed the tire was losing air. It's leaking from the valve. I pulled the valve out and did the method of using a small piece of rubber from an old tube and putting the valve through that to help it seal, made sure the tape was trimmed around the hole and it's still leaking. Apparently it could be leaking from anywhere and my last option is to pull the f****** tire and retape it or some BS. And of course I already put the sealant in it so now that will be $$ wasted.

Tubeless freaking sucks. Straight up sucks. I might make my 1 1/2 hour round trip to the shop to have them do it then sell the goda** bike and just ride my old Cannondale F4.
