No, I'll just deal with it tomorrow but I've never really been sold on dropper posts anyway. More weight, more cables, more maintenance and more stuff to go wrong. I just ordered a Ritchey Trail seatpost to match the bar and stem and drop a pound off the bike. I did take it for a 10 minute spin and it feels really nimble and lighter than it is, I like this modern geometry. I'll be hitting the singletrack in the morning.
