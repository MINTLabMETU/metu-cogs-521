January 03, 2007 - The Xootr Swift is temporarily out of stock due to unexpected demand.  We expect to receive our next shipment near
the end of February in 2007.



I don't know about Peter Reich's stock (steel frame) as I am interested in the ALU Version. I ordered mine directly from nycewheels.com. Should be arriving on Wed or Thurs.

As for the TravelAgents, I am using them on my 700cc Road Bike w/ Shimano 105 Groupset. I've had no problems w/ them. I'm going to go that route with the swift. I'll be posting back with my results once I've finished attempting the upgrades.
