I'm hoping to start building but I have no knowledge or experience. I'm going for a clean simple contemporary look along the fixed gear realm but with multiple gears. A frame up build. I'm hoping for some wisdom as to where to start, what avenues to pursue, and what to avoid. I really like the aesthetics of fixies but am more city/road inclined; so with more than 3 gears. Derailers are fine but as clean and simple as possible. A classy timeless look. I'll be applying a custom paint design. Not sure what yet but I'm going to be very picky as to the looks of the gears, the spokes, handlebars, materials, etc. Possibly some product sources and technical literature? Thanks everyone!
