Well, speed wasn’t my goal.  I also got improved ride quality as the larger wheel rides over roots and logs better.  Knowing that helps when you pick a line and I’m riding stuff that my FS would handle but my 26” HT has issues with.  Attendant with a new bike is better tires that are tubeless and run much less air pressure, so less bounce off objects as well as a tire designed for that pressure, so better grip in turns and while climbing.  And 1X which has a terrific range for where I ride and makes it easier not dealing with when to front shift.  Plus improved geometry which makes the 29’er a killer climbing bike.  And wider bars that help with control.  

You can retro a lot of this into a 26” wheeled bike, and if I had a really light and good carbon 26” bike, I could see doing tubeless/1X/wide bars/etc....  and I’d bet it would be a great bike, but sometimes it’s cost effective to go to a new bike.
