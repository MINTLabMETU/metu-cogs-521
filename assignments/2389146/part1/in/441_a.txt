The Mini is back home... 

What an unbelievable difference the Shimano BB makes.  The creaking is gone and it is soooo smooth...

The LBS said they had a really hard time getting the old BB out but the didn't have to drill it or anything like that.  I haven't looked at the old one very closely yet.  I'll report if I find anything this weekend when I have more time to examine it.

I left the VIIIH at the LBS to change the BB and downsize the chainring...
