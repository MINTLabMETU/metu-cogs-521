I jump down off curbs on my toughroad regularly in the process of avoiding traffic snarls.  But I wouldn't do it on a racer, like you say it's risky on such a bike.  I also regularly ride up over a sloping one onto a grassy median strip while crossing a busy divided road near home.  With the toughroad I can do this safely, I just put my bum back over the seat to unload the front.  It's a lot safer than riding up 200 meters to the nearest opening with cars and trucks zooming past a mere foot away.  When you have a bike capable of such you learn all kinds of shortcuts.  The Giant toughroad is a fast flatbar roadie but with offroad abilities.  A great technological advancement in cycling.
