This is going to be the route I take. I didn't want to do it, but after you and 10 Wheels explain it, it makes more sense. Hopefully riding a bike is like riding a car and you can figure out what you like and what you don't after a while. 


Also, thanks a ton for looking on Craigslist for me. I've looked at some many of those I can't tell what's worth it and what's not so you narrowing it down helped a ton. I looked at the 'Bicycle Bluebook" and it seems the Trek 2100 ZR is overpriced so I low balled him for $300.


The pink Trek I'm showing is valued at much higher than asking, so that looks to be a good deal. A new seat, a screwdriver, and some new tape will have that looking great!
