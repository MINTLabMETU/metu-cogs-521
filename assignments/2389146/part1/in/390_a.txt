What is the real benefit of 24"wheels ?  Smaller wheel roll as well and there is a much wider choice of tires in 20" ETRTO496 than in 24" ETRTO507.  There are no high performances road tires in 24" ETRTO507.

You can also consider the   The creators already sell the Vellobike and there are also nu-assisted and titanium frame version.  
The chance of success of the Vellobike+ seems much bigger (and faster) than the one of Helix.
