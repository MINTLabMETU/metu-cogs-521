So my first cant-brakes were on my 1985 Trek 720 and they were fine in 1985. Being a Clydesdale and riding in the wet wet Pacific Northwest as a mostly commuter but sometimes loaded camper brake weight was never my concern.

I have a similar vintage Raleigh Aleyeska touring bike with Paul Motolite V-brakes which are amazing. I use a Tekro road lever for V-brake pull.

Disks were a definite improvement on some bikes. I have a recumbent Easy Racers Titanium Gold Rush running a 40 spoke rear with a Mavic ceramic rim and a caliper brake which stops well.

Recently I bought a bike with XT hydraulic discs -- that setup is a nicer ride than Avid BB7
It is on a Nazca Fuego.

It is again a case of different strokes preferred by different folks.
Weight may be important or not. Rim wear may be important or not.
Inline brake levers may be important or not.

BUT brakes have definitely improved since the start of this thread.

Cants - V-brakes or neither... is where this ancient thread has moved.

If it is Cants vs V, I'll take Paul Motolites but I've never used Paul cants.
