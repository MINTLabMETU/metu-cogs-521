This may be the oldest thread on BF still being updated but it's not the longest, not by a long shot.

So I have no complaints about cantis. My experience with the tektro oryx is really different than jax's. I picked up a 2009 fuji touring with oryx cantilevers and I've been pleasantly surprised by how well they stop.

Even though I'm a long time canti fan, I like the way v brakes work a lot. Picked up a 1992 trek 950 recently; the PO had v brakes installed. I've been riding that bike a lot and I'm impressed with how well the v brakes work.
