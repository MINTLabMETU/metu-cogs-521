I still maintain a stable of 26" mountain bikes. Yes they're old, and outdated in comparison to modern mountain bikes. But for the trails that I ride on, which are mostly hard pack double track and carriage trails, a modern mountain bike is not required. 26" is cheap and perfectly suited to less demanding off-road fun.

Here's an old lugged 1990 Trek 950 that I just brought back from the dead.





This is the 1993 Rockhopper that I use for bikepacking.
