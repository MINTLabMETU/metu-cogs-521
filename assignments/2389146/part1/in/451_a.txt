I had the same problem on my Swift. This is a pretty common condition whenever aluminum (frame) and steel (BB cup) meet. Grease may help, but to truly prevent future seizing, I recommend anti-seize. You can grab a tube for cheap from your local auto parts store. Slather it on the threads of both the cup and bracket. (Oh yeah, and make sure you're turning the drive-side BB cup clockwise to remove...but you already knew that).
