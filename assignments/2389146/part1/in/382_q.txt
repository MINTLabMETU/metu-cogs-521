The thread is not dead until the fat lady's riding that bike singing O Fortuna.

It'll be a while yet  before shipping and I'm not sure they've locked down the lead times on the fat lady (under 105kg of course) just yet. So there will no doubt be plenty of time still for high drama, groundless speculation and outrageous accusations and defamations galore as testing and production ramping hit challenges. And that is before first impressions posts, user reviews and the inevitable critiques by people who haven't actually ridden the bike followed by long term impressions and reviews along with speculation and debate on the growth prospects of Helix etc.

The show will go on. This thread is spanky.
