Show me a company who has tried to hide all their failures by attempting to hide all their customers complaints and claims. There's been issues and recalls with numerous brands, but no other brand has had such a shoddy record. And it's STILL ongoing, with new bicycles. I'm a Tern owner, and I fear riding my folder from them. I'm confident riding my Dahon, Origami, and Downtube bikes. I know I won't experience the same disregard, or coverups, from these brands.
