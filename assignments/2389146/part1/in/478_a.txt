In general, I don't think there's any benefit to running different tires on the front and rear. The exception being possibly offroad bikes. A friend lent me his cross bike, and that had a knobby tire on the front for better braking/turning control on loose surfaces, and a slick on the back for low rolling resistance. But for a folding bike - unless you have a very special use case I'd say not.
