I thought this was a really good idea.  So I manually copied all the HTML pages and saved it on my hard drive (clunky way to do it, but best I could do on short notice). I did the same for Waveshrdr's reviews of the VIIIH and Mini.  I'll try to back them up periodically.  This information is too valuable for newcomers.  

If anyone wants a copy of these pages, let me know.
