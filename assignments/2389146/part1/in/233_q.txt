This is both inspiring and slightly terrifying...


Personally I use a pair of Shimano cantilevers, that I bought last fall. The old models of Shimano cantilever brakes used a plastic part to hold the spring in position, and these broke very easily. The new ones are actually pretty great quality, all metal, and are holding up well to winter riding. Cantilevers are a bit better for me as I ride in snow and they tend to leave more clearance around the wheel. They have plenty of stopping power, are easy to fix, and most importantly are CHEAP, which is a big deal for someone in my economic standing (unemployed minor).

I will concede though that a more evil to adjust braking system would be hard to come by. Installing both of them took more than an hour, and most of that was 
Step 1: adjust 
Step 2: tighten (if bumped while tightening, go to step 1) 
Step 3: test (if badly aligned, loosen and go to step 1) 
Step 4: ride (if badly adjusted, return to step one)
