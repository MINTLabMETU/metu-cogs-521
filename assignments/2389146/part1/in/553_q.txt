I ordered mine last Friday. They told me it would be a couple days for their accounting department to review the transaction since it was my first purchase with them. Identity theft etc. I'm okay with that. However, coupled with the holiday on Monday it didn't ship until Thursday with expected arrival this upcoming Wednesday. I ordered pedals and a shock air pump from them also.
