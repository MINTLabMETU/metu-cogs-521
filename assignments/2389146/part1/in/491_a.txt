It is dusty dry here and the sand/dust here are very fine which makes the tires dirty white especially the Kojak. I don't know but I tolerate and prefer the tires with mud and soil, but I really do not like white dust on the black tires.  In my route, there is this short dusty hardened desert that I pass everyday.  I will try car tire stuff to blacken them once in a while.
