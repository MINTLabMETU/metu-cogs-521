 At the risk of beating a dead horse, I would say that is fine.  To each his own.  I haven't jumped a curb in over 20 years.  And I don't see many adults doing stuff like that.  Life is too short to risk it, and a tire, tube and rim jumping curbs.

But I do take my Salsa on gravel, or occasionally on grass, dirt, crushed limestone, broken pavement, or whatever.  Because my bike has touring wheels and substantial tires. Panaracer Ribmo in 32 mm, though I am going to try some dirt and gravel riding in the spring on Panaracer Gravel King.  I don't ride much on sidewalks, if I can help it.

I thought I might like a classic hardtail mountain bike for more rustic rides, but I can count the times on one hand I have actually ridden my Trek 930 in the last two years.  But why?  I have wide, but smooth tires.  I suspect it is the riding position, combined with the flat bars, the heavy tires, and the 26" wheels.  The bike just feels sluggish.  There may eventually be a place I like to ride that is too rustic for my Salsa where I might find a hardtail mountain bike to be just the thing, but I haven't found it yet.

Now, maybe I am just an old curmudgeon, but I do think I have tried to love my old mountain bike.  But I discovered in short order single track isn't my thing and for general use, a bike with 700c wheels and tires more in the 28 to 32 mm is about right for me.  FWIW, I am not alone in that assessment.  My teenage son races mountain bikes and actually prefers single track to roads.  But when he is riding around town on pavement, he much prefers his road bike, as it is much more fun to ride on pavement.

While others may disagree, I don't think my experience is atypical.  I see the enjoyment my son gets from mountain biking, but even he only rides his mountain bike when he does single track.
