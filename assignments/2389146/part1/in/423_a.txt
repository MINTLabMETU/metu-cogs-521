Great idea!  I guess I could go to TAP plastics and have them cut a couple of clear acrylic rings with drill holes for the bolts.  Hmmm...  Do let us know what you come up with also.

   I'm very pleased with the way it turned out.  I'm new to folders and it's just a blast!  I've virtually rebuilt both of the DT's I just got.  The silver one rolls pretty smooth.  Other than the ribbing from my friends (e.g. "Hey doughnut boy!" or "What'd you do, put your bike in the dryer?" or "In this cold weather, everything shrinks  ." ), the bike is very enjoyable to ride. Oh yeah, and the best part is passing people on them small wheels.  I'm planning on doing a century with it some time soon.  Will post a ride report.
