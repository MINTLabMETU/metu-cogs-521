Are you really that obtuse? What it means in the context of this thread (read post #1 ) is that the availability of 27.5 bikes from the major bike manufacturers is in decline. As each year passes the major manufactures are starting to phase out 27.5 bikes just like they phased out 26 bikes. Most people are going for 29er so that's what manufactures are going to supply.

...Parts and service items will be available for a long time. But that's not what this thread is about. I have a 27.5" mtb which is starting to show its age, and I have started looking for a replacement. (without a hurry)
It might be just me, but it looks like 27.5" is going to have same fate as 26"? All the new mountainbikes seem 29"...

I'm a bit hesitant of switching to a 29'er, because of the slight loss of manoeuvrability (perhaps nothing to be worried about?)
