My Salsa does most of that, and can even handle some light touring. Handling flats is mostly a function of tires. I ride with Panaracer Ribmos.  Only 2 flats in 3 years, which isn't bad. I don't do time trials, do you?

A bit of slight of hand, smashing together mountain bikes and hybrids. I can see a person going with a hybrid as a do it all bike, though I personally prefer drop bars.  On the other hand, I agree with OP, modern lower priced mountain bikes suck as all rounders.
