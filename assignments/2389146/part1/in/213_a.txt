I have no idea what you mean by head movie. If anyone morphed the OP into their favorite rhetorical exercise it's you. You have quite the reputation here for looking down on bikes as being not worthy; why, I do not know. All I did was address the OP directly - as written.

But anyway, at least you agree that there is essentially nothing wrong with 27.5 other than popularity. Always my first criteria when buying a bike (not).

You can keep up the back and forth or drop it.. IDC. I have no problem pointing out the error of your ways.
