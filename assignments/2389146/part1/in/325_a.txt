Oziswift's bike certainly goes to show that you can do a full-blown road bike configuration with the Swift. If you're expecting the Swift to ride like a Giant OCR1, you will be disappointed. An aluminum frame riding on 20" wheels is nothing like a carbon 700C road bike. It's just not an apples-to-apples comparison. On the other hand, if you're looking for a versatile folding bike that can go from stock, to road bike, to fixie, and back again, then the Swift can certainly accommodate. If you like to tinker and tweak; if the end result is a truly unique and personal machine, then the Swift will fit the bill. If you want a carbon dream machine, then get a carbon dream machine.
