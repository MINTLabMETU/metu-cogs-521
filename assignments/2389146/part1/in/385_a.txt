I've being doing the same market survey since a couple years ago.  The Helix really is the ultimate geeky fast-folding suitcase friendly bike.  (Brompton is a fine machine, but it's spendy, long in the tooth, & tiny wheels suck off road.)  My trusty old Dahon Helios will serve me until the Helix arrives, so I'll endure the expected wait (pre-ordered in Jan 2017).

Start-up companies with big dreams....not for the impatient they are.
