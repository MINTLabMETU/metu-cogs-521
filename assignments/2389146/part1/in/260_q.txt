To all you with fixed Swifts or hub-gear Swifts..

My hub-gear Swift dropped the chain for the first time today. It went back on really easily, and when I look at it and think about chain tension, I guess chain-stretch has just crept up on me without me noticing. 

So the question is, should I just move the rear wheel back to take up the slack and readjust my gear cable? Or is the chain potentially close to wearing out and needs replacing? I've never had a chain stretch this noticeably before, and I've had hub-gear bikes for years.

thanks, Magnus
