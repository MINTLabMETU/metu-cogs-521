As a bit of a novice when it comes to mods, I've not done anything extremely exciting or even extreme when compared to the mods done by you or the others on this list. I wanted (needed) better gearing for the extreme grades around here so opted for a DualDrive, that's how Peter got involved. I also wanted a black bike, so have gone the (foolish?) step of having a Xootr frame stripped and powder coated. Otherwise the only special item is a B17 saddle. I had thought of some other handlebar and/or brake changes, but am thinking I'll be making some changes once I've had the bike for a bit.
