 Except, of course, that the person who said that also explained how he pulled a 747 while jogging. People who don't have a point to prove can see right away that he was making a joke.

Your statement, on the other hand, was made totally seriously and disparaged everyone who rides a bike and doesn't get a workout.

Like yourself, I ride for many reasons ...  neither of us are simple people, I am sure. I enjoy the health benefit of riding ...  but then that s because Usually my riding style requires some exertion.

There is a wonderful older couple which  cruises the neighborhood each evening (when the weather is nice) on electric-assist cruisers. I am sure they get less exercise that way than walking around the block, and only slightly more than walking to the refrigerator or bathroom. Yet, it is an enjoyable part of their daily rituals. They Most Certainly aren't doing anything "wrong," and they most certainly aren't getting a workout.

When I am too old to pedal all the way around the block, I will probably get an E-bike just to get off the freaking couch and out in the air for a few minutes. When you get old, being outside can be the high point of the day ...  being old can really suck.

Anyway, neither of us intended to harm the other, nor I am sure do we bear one another malice. It is all just friendly discussion on a message board.

I will dare to assume we both like cycling. If I am wrong, so be it. Further than that, I will not assume. I can be an a$$ without making assumptions.
