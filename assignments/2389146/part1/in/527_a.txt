Agreed here too.  My roadbike is sporting a CK headset and I'll come right out now and say that while the quality is there and I have no doubt it will probably still be kicking strong when cockroaches rule the Earth, a headset that's 1/4 the price would probably have worked equally well.  I had the cash and felt the need to splurge.  As for the headset on my MTB, it's a RaceFace ThermoSP and has served me quite well over the past six years.  The seals seem to work pretty well.  I would get another.
