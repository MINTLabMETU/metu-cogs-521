gpsblake has a very valid point.  Road bikes have been optimized to reduce aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance.  The  you can go 16 to 18 mph on a road bike but can't do the same speed on a mountain bike is because the road bike is easier to get up to that speed.  Push a mountain bike up to that speed (they do much more than 10 mph on the road) and you are working far harder than on a road bike.  

Essentially, you have to work harder, i.e. burn more calories per hour, to push a mountain bike faster.

The problem here is that it easier to ride a road bike further because the road bike is easier to move down the road.  Do a long ride on a road bike then do the same long ride on a mountain bike with knobbies.  You can go faster on the road bike which means less time and less energy burned than you can on a mountain bike.
