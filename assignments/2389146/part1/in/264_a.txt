Well, I don't have a Carradice bag.. but my laptop does fit in my Nashbar waterproof front panniers and I commute with it every day.. 

I've been meaning to post for a while, but never got around to taking pictures. I continue to do all my shopping and errands on my Swift - and if you click on my blog link below you'll see some pics of the bike loaded up with panniers (& TP!) The panniers fit fine on the rack, but I did decide to modify the lower pannier mounting, since I had nothing for the hook to attach to.

The beady-eyed amongst you may also see I've added fenderes/mudguards. They're Zefal kids ones, which only cost $5 from a French webstore, and happen to fit rather well. They also snap on/detach in a few seconds, so very convenient for somewhere like SF that is mostly sunny but gets really wet when it first chooses to rain..
