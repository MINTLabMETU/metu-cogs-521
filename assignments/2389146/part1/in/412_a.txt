What is a diameter of the seat tubes on the DT IX (front suspension) and IX NS (no suspension) models? Do these models accept a FD? 

What is a diameter of the top steering tube (just below a stem)?

On a page for , specification for the cassette is 11-12-14-16-18-21-24-28, that is only 8 speed (and the name of the page is ...VIIINS). What is the actuall cassette on the IX NS?

What is the difference between IX (front suspension) and IX NS (except the suspension and the pedals)? Why is the NS more expensive?

Thanks.
