26" Will be around for a while longer but not in any capacity that can be considered anything more than ultra budget or used. Modern geometry has rendered all but a few older 26's obsolete. Geometry rules the roost if you're looking for a highly capable bike with modern components. 27.5"/650b is close enough to 26" that it's tough to feel a difference. 29" has now come of age and is very capable without feeling sluggish when up to speed.

As a diehard 26" fanatic for years I finally had to lower my flag after owning a couple of newer bikes. The geometry trends of newer bikes works & works well. They just perform better on the trail & in the air. Sure you can still have a great time on a 26" bike but if you are pushing the limits you'll benefit from the modern geometry & compoents that just happen to roll on wheels that aren't 26"
