I started off with a used 2008 Roubaix and love it.  I paid next to nothing for it without wheels and just got a set of new take off mavic 7's for $120.  Added tires and tubes and I road that thing happily until I got a frame 54" frame instead of the 58" since the 58" was just too big.  It has dura ace shifters and a rear derailleur that shifts like butter.  I have been told it will be even better with a new cassette and cables which should run less than $100 total.   Total costs for the bike was around $700 and it shifts just as good if not better than my new tarmac with full ultegra on it.
