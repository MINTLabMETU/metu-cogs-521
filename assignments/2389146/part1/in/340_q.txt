Thx for the pics DaKineDatFolds! But... which one is the final design? My guess would be picture 3 (Ti-Seatpost, round rear triangle) which would mean no internal cable routing... I love the clean looks of pics 1 & 5, but even there the front cable routing does not seem (aesthetically) ideal. Routing back break & shifter cable in the back triangle would be the cherry on the cake, but presumably tricky because of the fold.
