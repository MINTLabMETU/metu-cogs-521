I just ordered front and back Avid sd 7 V-brakes, Avid Speed dial 7 brake levers, new cables and housings, and new Kool Stop mtb dual compound pads.  All for $93.00 including shipping via Price Point with their mtb blow-out sale.  I hope this new set-up is awesome, it should be in next week.  Many people claim the Avid V-brakes are better than the cheaper disc set ups, only time will tell.
