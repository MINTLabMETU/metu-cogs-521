The bicycle industry is totally fashion driven so going to another wheel standard is a common practice in the interest of promoting new bicycle sales.  The US bicycle industry is roughly 6 billion dollars a year.  This is big money.  Walmart sells a lot of bicycle shaped devices.  Walmart probably alone sells more bicycles than brand name Trek, Specialized, Giant combined.  A lot of the bicycles are made by Giant anyway and branded for Walmart or others.  I was not able to access the exact percentage of the US bicycle market that Walmart services but I'm sure it is huge.  I see Walmart/Target bikes being ridden by adults in their day to day endeavors all the time.  I see more of those bicycles being used than brand name bicycles.  Walmart sells huge amounts of children bicycles as you brought up but their products are being used by vast amounts of adult cyclists.  If Walmart continues to sell 26" wheeled bicyles including MTB's then that wheel size may not die off like the 27" wheel size did.  I still ride a 27" wheeled bicycle because parts are easy to come by and cheap all these many years after the last new ones were sold.  Like you I'll keep an eye on the 650B experiment, maybe it is going away.  Who knows.
