How many people have told you this? I bet none, right?

Most road cyclists are Aware that if they fall the left in traffic, they die, because cars passing wont have time to avoid them.

Most road cyclists I know are aware that a car can come out of any driveway or side street and completely obliviously plow over a cyclistand it happens often enough to be an issue.

Most road cyclists I know that cars will stop, turn, try to beat a light, whatever ...  Completley without interest or awareness of any cyclists which might be in the area.

 Its not the Bike which can handle uneven surfaces, it is the Rider.

If you lack the technical ability to ride safely on the road, please do not.

These ridiculous assumptions can only be the basis for ridiculous arguments. make whatever assumptions you like ...  and whatever ridiculous arguments.

I have crashed- badly on and off-road. I have crashed badly on every type of bike. I have twice gotten a concussion cycling---both time on an MTB.

If you could buy safety buy buying wider tires, wider tires would be mandatory. Of course, you cannot even buy the Illusion of safety with any specific tire width or frame style ...  which is why there are no such bike safety laws.

Safety is 95 percent rider and five percent luck. And No bicycle is safe, except the one you Dont ride.

Smart riders know that the pleasure more than justifies the risk. Smart riders also know that safety is in no way tied to tire width.
