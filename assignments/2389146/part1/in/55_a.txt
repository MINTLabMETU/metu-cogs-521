You call people names who think differently than you do, then you talk about self-examination....

You are not in good enough shape to ride a real MTB on real MTB trails, then state they all other bikes are better everywhere else, as though your view of this is more important than those who want to ride their MTB wherever, just because they find it fun....

You call people idiots for saying MTBs are more fun, as though the rest of us are not entitled to express our opinions as related to the OP.

You generalize that people riding MTBs around town are riding low budget bikes... Closed minded, maybe....

Self-examination is difficult, isn't it!!!

Bandera mentioned getting in his base miles on his fixed gear road bike. I think he is completely CRAZY. However, I hope he does not care what I think. I think MTBs are way more fun than road bikes, and that is my answer to the OP. 

I hope each person actually has fun with the bike type they are most interested in. I don't even care if they are closed minded about it, as long as we can have a discussion that does not lower itself to name calling, unless we know each other well enough to be friends, and the name calling leads to laughter. 

MTBs Rule!!!
