Well, not exactly.  I meant to say "But, I'm pretty sure you can go from 135 through-axle to with the right end caps".  I hope I didn't make this any more confusing.  The point is that I don't think they make end caps that can go from 135 spacing to Boost spacing.  They actually moved the cassette, didn't they?  I don't really know.  I'm currently running 142 on my main bike, 148 on my HT, and I do have a few 135 in the stable, but I've never bothered or had the need to convert them.
