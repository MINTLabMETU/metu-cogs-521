The Nashbar long-reach brakes max-out at 56mm. I measured the distance between the brake pivot bolt hole to the center of the rim braking surface on my Swift, and it measured 82mm. What will work, however, are the Tektro 984 Extra Long Reach Calipers (88mm reach). These brakes are for BMX applications, so I'm not sure if road levers will have enough pull.
