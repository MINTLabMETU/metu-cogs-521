So my tires came with tubes and I wanted to convert it to tubeless, despite all the problems I've read people have had dealing with tubeless. Never used them myself. Got my valves and sealant and went to work yesterday because I was planning on riding all day today.

HOLY FU**ING SHI*

This is a nightmare I never dreamed of. It's just not happening and my riding plans for today have gone up in flames. After a few hours I have accomplished getting the tube out of the front tire. That's it. I refuse to buy an air compressor just to mount freaking bicycle tires and even if I wanted to, or wanted to use one at the gas station, I have no presta adapter and no place to buy one because I live in the country with no bike shops. I can't do the put the tube back in/pump up to seat bead method because I CAN'T GET THE DAMN BEAD BACK OFF TO PUT THE TUBE BACK IN. And now I also know if I get a bad puncture on the trail or a sidewall cut, using a tube to make it back just isn't going to happen. I'll be screwed. I'm pissed beyond words. Sorry, had to rant. I don't even want to look at the damn bike now.
