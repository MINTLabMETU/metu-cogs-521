I am thinking about getting the swift sometime soon and I noticed that the main site says they are out of stock. Does anybody know if the new frame improvements (e.g. broken seat post area ala James_swift) will be part of the late January run or do we need to wait a little longer? 

I'm assuming the latest updates will be in march-april?

Also, is it possible to replace the v-brakes w/ road brakes? Will the rear triangle and front fork mount points work? I'm thinking of using these:

Nashbar Long Reach

This will be a drop-bar conversion (trying to avoid travel agents)
