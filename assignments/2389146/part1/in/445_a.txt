I have also come to the conclusion that the internal hub is ideal for folders and people who don't want to tinker with their bikes.  Very impressive performance and range. I don't think that it would cost a whole lot less, though.  It would be somewhat more expensive, but worth it.

Not that I need any more folders, but if I were to get another one, it would be a internal hub version.
