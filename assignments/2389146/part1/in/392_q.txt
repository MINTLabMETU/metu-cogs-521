Kojak are fragile tires that wear fast.

Vello also experience delay but nothing comparable with Helix and within about one month we will see if their promises are real or... just promises what is not the case for Helix. Velo creators have experience of building bikes, they were successful with their first mode what is not the case of the Helix creator.  And the Vellobike+ frame is build by am experienced bike frame builder what is not the case for Helix that combines the risks of wrong bike design and wrong frame manufacturing. On bikes without suspension, what makes them comfortable is the tire type and width, not really the size and not for the relatively small difference between ETRTP406 and ETRTO507.
Bigger wheels also increase the weight. But, as you say, at this stage where none of those two bikes exists, it is a question of taste and confidence in the creator(s).
