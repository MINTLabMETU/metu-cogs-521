He he, I met James_Swift on Caltrain last week, and we had a laugh at how tall my bike looked compared to his 

Yes it is..

I used some heavy duty picture hooks from the local hardware store. They're stainless, and rated at 100 lbs, so should hopefully stand up to the punishment! I had to hack them a little to make them fit, but they were less than $2  There's a close-up picture on the blog linked below.
