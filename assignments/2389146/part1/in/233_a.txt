I like cantilevers as well.  I have had them on several bikes, as I am typically a bit of a C&V guy and have owned and ridden several mid 80's to early 90's mtb's. One thing I really like about the cantilever brakes is that there is a lot of adjustment possible as far as how much mechanical advantage you want.  I like to run the yoke pretty low to get really powerful brakes.
