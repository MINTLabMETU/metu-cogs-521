One more question before I feel confident in buying the 9 speed MK3, for riders 5'5" or shorter, do you struggle to reach the bar?  Do you have to extend your arm 100% out and lean to get a good handle on the bar which makes it very uncomfortable to ride?  Or are you able to ride comfortable and don't need to extend your arms all the way out?
