No I am not obtuse. Here, let's look at that post 1 again.

In that context, as you yourself agree, the OP could buy a 27.5 and have parts and service for their bike for a long time. Whatever is happening statistically in the market does not effect the individual once they buy their bike. They have it, parts are available, it should last a good while.

So... 27.5 within the OP's context is not dead, though that term is weak. More accurately, as I described in my response, it will not suffer from availability issues (parts) but may fall out of popular favour - if that is the sole motivating factor for buying a bike. However, rest assured, any bike purchased today will also fall out of popular favour in a couple of years anyway.

We can answer this two ways:

If you find a 27.5 you like.. buy it. There will be parts available for a long time - enjoy your ride.

If you find a 27.5 you like.. don't buy it. There will be parts available for a long time but 29 is more popular so you won't enjoy your ride.
