Huh, why are you declaring 29/27.5+ bikes to be a sign of 29ers taking over 27.5+ territory and not the other way around? Sorry, but that just does not hold water. Plus size has decreased in numbers and popularity from a few years ago, but is clearly NOT going away at this point. Which throws water on your assertion that since you see less of something that it is a sign of going away completely.

We've already gone through your circular logic on this several times, and I already addressed your faulty logic with the Giant argument.

You keep declaring that there will soon be no 27.5 produced, but the only evidence you ever show is that there are fewer models sold now than a few years ago. That does not show that they are going completely away, just like it did not indicate that plus bikes were.
