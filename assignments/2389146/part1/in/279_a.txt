Wow.  I'll be keeping any eye on mine, especially because I keep making the clamps a little tighter to kill some minor creeks.  How much pressure were you using to close the top q/r?  I know it's hard to quantify, but was it always really tight?  Like it left an impression on your palm, and you had to brace the bike while closing?

I'd heard about some forthcoming minor changes from Peter when I ordered mine a couple of months ago.  I'm looking foward to your description of them.  The only specifics I recall were different (bigger?) gussets at the headtube, I think.
