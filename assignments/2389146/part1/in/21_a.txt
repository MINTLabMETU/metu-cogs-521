I'd agree that you'll want to get a used/less expensive bike, ride a thousand miles (or more) and figure out what you want in your 'real' bike.  The added benefit is that you'll save some money, initially, that can be spent on BIB shorts (don't bother with non bib shorts, they'll end up unused in the bottom of a drawer once you buy a set of bibs) and all the other stuff you'll need (shoes, jerseys, glasses, flat repair kit, helmet, etc.)  

I took the liberty of picking a few 58cm bikes off the detroit craigslist and there are a few that are excellent candidates:

 (nice bike other than the pink stuff, note that the description of the shifters as Tiagra doesn't match the bike in the picture.  Double check this one in person.)
