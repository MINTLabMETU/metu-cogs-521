Well, I can confirm the handlepost stem from the monocoque fits the classic frame perfectly! The carbon seatpost on the other hand looks good but not practical for a folding bike where it needs to be raised and lowered repeatedly, the clear coating is coming off at an alarming rate.  As I can't have the seatpost too tight, being carbon, it slides down after a while... Happy with the result nonetheless.
