 Sorry James, I couldn't resist.  And you'll be quite correct in point out that riser bars aren't flat!  Personally, I like the look of flat and riser bars better on the Swift and most folders.  Drops just look weird.  But my hands can never get comfortable with my wrists in a flat bar position, so I'm aiming to put drops on my swift.
