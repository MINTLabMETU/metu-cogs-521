Pretty much this. 

Having been in the sport since 1990, I cannot recall one piece of equipment that had such a rapid adoption rate. Not suspension, not disc brakes, nothing. When Vs came out, all serious MTBers got em. Overnight. And never looked back

Also, it killed the entire aftermarket brake industry
