...Helix went to some effort to make them appear like computer renderings. ...they are definitely pictures of a real bicycle taken by a professional, under professional lighting. Potentially photoshopped. What gives it away is the tires, you can see slight variations in color and the molding markings. I know CGI has come a long way but I am convinced it's real. ...does the test bike have internal cable  routing? To me that's aesthetically the biggest shortcoming of this  otherwise beautiful bike, and I'm surprised nobody else has brought this  up. My Brompton? No. Circa 2004.
