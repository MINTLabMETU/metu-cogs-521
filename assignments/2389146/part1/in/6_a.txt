Did you call on it? If the bike frame is your size, the price is ok if the drivetrain works well, frame has no dents or cracks and rims arent too far out of true. Cannondales will hold their value and among Vintage cyclists will command a premium. Factor in the cost of what you would change. If you want long distance riding, throw that seat out.

"OBO" means they dont expect 175.00 so offer them 120.00 or so.
