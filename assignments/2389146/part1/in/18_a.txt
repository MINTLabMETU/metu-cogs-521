I haven't looked at the groupset, but the chief difference between the two models is relaxed v. racing geometry. The Sportif is the former. Do you want to be more upright? Get the Sportif. Want to feel aggressive (i.e. lower)? Get the Roubaix. Go for a ~1hr ride with your Roubaix - if you don't like the neck/lower back pain (which gets better as you accustom to the position), switch out. 


I'm guessing you got it at Performance Bike, in which case you have a full year to make up your mind.
