I'm trying to fit rim brakes to a fork with narrow 55mm wide post centers combined with 22.5mm wide rims. I need suggestions for cantilever brakes with short arms and highly adjustable pad placement or I will need suggestions for V-brakes, if cantilevers are not going to fit. Both the angle of the pad and the height of the pad needs to be adjustable.

Any suggestions?
