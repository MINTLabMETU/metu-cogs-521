Peter has said it should take 2-3 weeks. This estimate has slightly better credibility than his previous schedule predictions since it has to be from the test lab, but as Jipe has already pointed out, there's potential for delay if (heaven forbid) it fails to meet one of the test criteria for any reason. Let's hope there aren't any nasty little stress risers lurking under the surface of those "perfect" welds.
