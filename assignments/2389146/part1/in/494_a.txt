For the past two years there hasn't been any issue with the bike.  Wheels will need to be true once in a while and any LBS can fix that.  I think 18" wheels can be purchase online.  You should be able to purchase most of the parts online.  If you are near the NYC area, Bfold will service your birdy.  I'm not an expert but I've learn a little of how to maintain the bike and tune ups.  Check out their website and you can call the store for more info.

Edit: just found this on their website: bfold is an authorized dealer for Brompton, birdy, Xootr / Swift, Bike Friday, Strida, Moulton, Pashley-Moulton, Carry-Me, REACH, Dahon, Tern and Catrike.
