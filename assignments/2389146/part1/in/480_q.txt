I bought a used "classic" Birdy (pre-2003) on Craigslist. The price was right, and I like it a lot. I had ridden a borrowed newer-model Birdy before, and loved the ride. I've also test ridden  a Bike Friday and some other folders, but hate the rough ride of a small-wheeled bike without a suspension, especially in front.

The Birdy I got has no fenders/mudguards or rack. I don't need a rack, but I would like fenders/mudguards.

The local Birdy dealers (Warm Planet in San Francisco and Urban Bike Fitters in Fremont, CA, USA) say the classic Birdy models lack the mounting points for the current Birdy-specific racks or fenders.

(1) Does anyone know a currently-available fender-mudguard set that will fit a classic Birdy? I'm wiling to do *some* hacking to make it fit, but I'm not an expect and don't want to drill the frame.

(2) Once upon a time, fenders/mudguards were made for the classic Birdy. Somewhere there is probably a NOS set collecting dust in the back of a shop. Does anyone know of a Birdy dealer that might be likely to have one?

(3) I'm in the USA, but I'm going to be in Amsterdam and Brussels next month, probably with my Birdy. Can anyone recommend a shop in either of those cities that sells a lot of Birdys, or that has a large variety of folding bike accessories and might have something that could be made to fit my older Birdy?

(I've posted a separate message about the size of a folded classic Birdy as airline luggage, slightly related only to the extent that fenders/mudguards might slightly increase the folded dimensions.)

Thanks for any tips, experience, or advice.
