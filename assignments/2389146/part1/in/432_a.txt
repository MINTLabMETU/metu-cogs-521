That is completely understandable, afterall, it's only November and the next DTs are not due out until June.  However, I do have a question about the current line up:  why does the NS lack the support tube (running from the bottom bracket to the main tube) that is featured on all of the other DT models?  Does it have to do with the NS using a rigid fork?
