Your experience probably jives with what Morgan said about dry lubes.  New chains have that factory coating which is real slippery.  Over time that probably wore off and your chain became less slick and the chain drop stopped.  

I plan to go fast on this bike, so I want to be confident about it not dropping.  I think I'll try pm124's idea of a chainguard.  Should be cheap and easy.  I'll let you know what happens.
