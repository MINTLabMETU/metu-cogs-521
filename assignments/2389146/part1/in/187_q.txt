I realise this is a US focused forum so from the perspective that the US retail market specialist bike shops are gradually reducing 27.5" bikes may be correct but shouldn't extend that out to the world where the European market may be different and buys mores bikes and 26" mountain bikes still dominate in China with much larger sales. Also seems unfair to completely dismiss the lower priced bikes, walmart, amazon etc many of which are used for leisure use and very easy trails which are dominated by 26" bikes.

Most of my bikes are older 26" mountain bikes I must admit but then I'm not a serious off-roader just like to explore the country side and I like to buy bikes pretty cheaply.
