I do wish someone would make an aluminum (or other metal, steel, lead, I don't care) replacement for those plastic spring holders on the 90's shimano cantilevers.  I have a couple pairs I liked really well, but when those things broke, it made adjusting the spring tension a pain in the ass, so they're sitting in my parts bin not doing anything and I'd love to throw some KoolStop salmons on them and get them back on the road.
