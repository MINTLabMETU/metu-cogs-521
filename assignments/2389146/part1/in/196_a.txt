Appears the 29er "re-popularity" may, currently, be a more of a regional phenomenon....spoke with the owner of my LBS when I stopped in for a bottle of Squirt and Stan's yesterday.
In Steamboat Springs it is right at 50/50 for 27.5 v. 29 sales last season (in his opinion).
Following the vast popularity of the 27.5 adoption, 29er frame manufacturers have re-tooled the frame geometry (altered seat & chain stay length) to shorten the overall length of the 2nd Gen 29er to help mitigate the turning radius limitation concerns.
