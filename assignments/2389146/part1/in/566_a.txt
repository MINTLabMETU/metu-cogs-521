In 30+ years no mechanic has ever touched my bikes. But I think I'll have to run into town and have someone do these damn wheels. I've already busted one tire lever and I'm afraid I'll end up damaging the beads. What I really don't like is when I'm out on the trail it will always be in my head that if I get a puncture and the sealant won't work, which happens, I'll be walking because there's no way in hell I would be able to put a tube in. I don't like that. Sometimes old technology is just better no matter what the new generation says, and this is a prime example.

That being said, if I were you I would convert it to tubeless because your chances of getting a flat are reduced. You aren't going to be able to take that tube out and patch/replace it on the trail. At least I sure as hell ain't.
