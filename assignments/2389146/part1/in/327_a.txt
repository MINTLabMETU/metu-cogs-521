Yeah ... a NWT with 105 components and drop bars is something like $2000.  But if you are set on a derailer drivetrain (front and back) then it is probably your best bet.  

If you are interested in a fixed gear, talk to Walter at BF.

If you search this thread, you will probably find reference toa Japanese guy that makes a clamp for a 40mm seat tube to which you could attach a braze-on front derailer.  Last I checked, after converting from Yen, it was about a $100.  

Note that with the Swift, you will then have to consider the bend to the front derailer cable.  You could split the cable--with the method that coupled bikes use--to avoid the bend; but it already sounds like a lot of work.
