Are you really that obtuse? What it means in the context of this thread (read post  ) is that the availability of 27.5 bikes from the major bike manufacturers is in decline. As each year passes the major manufactures are starting to phase out 27.5 bikes just like they phased out 26 bikes. Most people are going for 29er so that's what manufactures are going to supply.

Giant is a perfect examples of this. A few years ago they went all in on 27.5. They had only a few 29. Now they have been slowly phasing them out. I think they learned that going all in on 27.5 was a mistake.

For 2020 models Giant had eight 29 and five 27.5. For 2021 Giant has eleven 29 and three 27.5. By 2022 you probably can expect that giant will have one or two 27.5 offerings.





Sure...Parts and service items will be available for a long time.  But that's not what this thread is about.
