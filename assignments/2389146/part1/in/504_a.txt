The specs of the Mark 2 Birdy I am interested in is this:



Is $1,500 a good deal for that bike?  Or is this $1,850 Mark 3 Birdy better and worth the extra money over the Mark 2?  .  Also Birdys are pretty fast?  I know it mostly depends on the rider and how much effort is put in but just curious if it can go fast compared to other folding bikes
