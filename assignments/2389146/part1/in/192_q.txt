Myself and Linda we rode e-bikes for a week in Belgium and I have to admit it's quite intoxicating. I'm afraid to ride one on our trails here because I'm pretty sure I would like it. But I'm not yet ready to give up what I enjoy about pedaling my own weight around. Plus, if I bought one I'd have to get one for Linda too...
