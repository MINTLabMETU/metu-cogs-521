OK, I was looking at a Schwinn CrossFit inside a Canadian Tire and noticed that between the brifters and the cross-top or interrupter levers, the cross-top levers seemed like I didn't need to pull a lot to get the brakes to work.  With the brifters, I had the impression I had to pull farther, longer to get the brakes to the rim.

Like are short-pull brakes going to get there faster then you start pulling on the brake levers.
