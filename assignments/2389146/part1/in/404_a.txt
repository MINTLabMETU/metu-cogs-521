PM: Thanks for the link.  So, it says I have to get 68x115 as a replacement for the original.  However, don't I have to get a longer BB for a dual chainring?  Or am I mistaken about that?

As for the carbon crank, you raise a good point about it being scratched.  But, it's just sitting around right now, I may as well put it to good use.  And given what I've read about the DT, plus the changes I plan to make, I may well be riding it a lot.  I'm primarily a roadie, so my DT won't see too many dirt trails.  

The 105 derailleurs may be over the top, but it is still a ways from the DT owner that put DuraAce on her bike.  Wow.  

I am planning to change the saddle, pedals and tires on my bike (when it finally arrives!).  I think those are easy and high impact changes to make the bike faster.  Very interesting to read that you were pleased with just rebuilding the original wheels.  I'll have to look carefully at mine.   

Thanks!
