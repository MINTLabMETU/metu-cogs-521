Some just join in for the pure silliness of this topic. I will keep saying MTBs are the best because they are the most fun. However, I hope nobody cares and nobody listens, so I have wide open trails. 

I come to BF to hopefully hear about something new I would like to try, then my ADD gets the best of me at times and I join in be of these ridiculous threads, adding little value, but how could anyone add much value to a discussion as shallow as this one. The only threads that seem to function at a lower level are the arguments about Ebikes. Imagine how bad an EMTB thread could get.

What were we talking about......
