Trust me.  27.5 will die off like 26" did.   Lack of sales will eventually kill it.

Not sure about where you ride, but where I ride we have weekly group rides at various trails in the area and 27.5 bikes are scarce.  Maybe one or two in a group of a dozen or more people and they are usually Giants because giant wasn't selling 29 Anthems and Trances for a few years.
