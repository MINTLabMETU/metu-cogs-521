Yeah you guys have convinced me with great arguments. So I come back to foldingdroid question: are custom made suspensions better than the original ones? Which are to be preferred?

P.S.: next week I would like to deal with a vendor for a test BD3 speed at Â€1.770 than I'll start the tuning time concerning weight and other stuffs like maybe a Gates carbon drive (I know this would mean to change the great Ultegra).
