Wait, so there's only one Birdy model and that model is only a demo?  How long would it take for the bike to arrive ta the store if we order through them?  And is it a good idea to buy online from this place?






They aren't an official dealer but looks like they have it, tax free and can ship immediately.  Also is that the latest model?
