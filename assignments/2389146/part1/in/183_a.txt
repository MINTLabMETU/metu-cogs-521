This conversation relates to complete bikes being sold by all bike manufacturers.

26" wheels and their components...yes you can still purchase all of that from online bike stores such as Jenson etc. But you will be hard pressed to find any of the major mountain bike companies selling a 26" mountain bike. 

So yes...26" is dead.  The 26" offerings out there are limited to department store bikes which are junk.
