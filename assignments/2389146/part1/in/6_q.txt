Looking for a used bike and I really have no clue to what I looking for. I don't ride often but would like a bike that I can ride long distance once in a while. My sister has a Cannondale road bike which I like. I found this one on criags list, Cannondale road bike for sale 175 O.B.O, is it worth it? I know the back tire will need to be replaced.
