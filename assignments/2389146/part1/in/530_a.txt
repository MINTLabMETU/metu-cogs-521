No, they're not. For the rider who prefers instant pedal response, there is  to a King hub (Hadley 108 pt is very similar, though).

I have a King headset that has been on multiple bikes and multiple forks over an eight year span with no sign of wear or failure, and zero maintenance required. Just another data point.
