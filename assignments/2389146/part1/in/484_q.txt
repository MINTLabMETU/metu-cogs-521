Looking online at their website, I found no reference to Warm Planet Bikes selling Birdy bikes... unfortunately!

Urban has, I believe, only one model of Birdy available to examine and demo. The owner indicated that he can order and obtain the other models and that he does service them. 

It seems odd, and disappointing, that there is currently only one Birdy vendor in the country; my impression as a result of a brief test ride is that its a great folder. Living in the Pacific Northwest, when the weather turns water, I intend to return to Urban Bicycles to take a longer test ride before committing to ordering a bike.
