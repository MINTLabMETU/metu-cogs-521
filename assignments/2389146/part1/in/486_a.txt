Interesting prospect to minimize gearing on a Birdy .. 

I've had a few Birdy bikes through the years, both with the excellent Sachs 3x7, the SRAM Dual Drive, as well as straight derailleur gearing... 

If you went with a small IGH 2 or 3 speed (any hub with more gears gets to be a pretty heavy wheel, although Birdy does offer a Rohloff version), you would still need a chain tensioner to handle the excess chain when folding as well as maintaining normal riding tension to compensate for the vertical dropouts .. coaster brakes don't work well with spring loaded tensioners or derailleurs .. 

If I wanted to reduce gearing and convert a Birdy to IGH to use as a commuter, I'd consider a 3 speed non-coaster with small chain tensioner .. you'd lose the weight of the cassette, large derailleur and one shifter/cable combo.. I ride a Moulton 3 speed IGH all the time and find the gearing sufficient for moderately hilly Marin county roads..
