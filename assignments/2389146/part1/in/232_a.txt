Thanks,  I really like my Rockhopper. I just bought it off craigslist a month or  so ago and it had hardly been ridden. It is a solid bike that seems to  be up to taking a beating. I really think I would have to pay about 5x as much to get something of comparable quality new. I am sure your son will have fun with yours.


The brakes, however, seem to be the only weak link on mine.  I  think in part it may be because somebody replaced the original levers  with some generic unknown make and model.  I guess they did it as a  byproduct of upgrading the shifters. I have to set the pads ridiculously  close to the rims  (< 1mm) to have a reasonable brake lever pull. The  brakes themselves are low end Shimano's and I seem to have to adjust  them after every ride.   So I decided to just get rid of the whole  braking system and start over.

My original plan was to find some  decent used disk wheels and buy new Avid BB7,s and new levers. Which  would have cost $250-$300.00 for everything.  But in researching all  that I came across so many glowing reviews of the Avid V brake system,  which could be had at about 1/3 the price (and they are much lighter)  that I decided to give V's one more shot.  It is mostly dry weather  here, though it has been a snowy couple weeks and I try not to let the  snow stop me if I have time to ride.
