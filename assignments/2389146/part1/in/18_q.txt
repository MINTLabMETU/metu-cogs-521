Hello everyone. I am new to this forum and I do apologize if I am posting this in the wrong place but I need some assistance. I just bought a Fuji Roubaix 1.5 2014 model for 799. I was also really looking to get the Fuji Sportif 2.3 2015. I am really stuck and do not know what to do. I am strongly debating on returning the Roubaix and getting the Sportif but I am not sure that is the right choice. This is my first bike in almost 14 years and I am just starting to get in to cycling. Can I please have some help from some people that know more about this then I do. I would really appreciate it. Thanks.
