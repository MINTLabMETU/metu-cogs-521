+1, True, True.  Some compare good V's to low end discs.  I can't remember anyone comparing cantis to disc, at best only to low end Vs.  I had the older, floating head XT Vs with salmon colored koolstops.  They stopped every bit as fast as the Avid BB7s's I replaced them with.  BUT, the discs modulate way better so I'm glad I made the change.  I think turky lurkey is right.  If he ever decides to go to discs, I would recommend nothing less than BB 5s or 7s or hydraulic.
