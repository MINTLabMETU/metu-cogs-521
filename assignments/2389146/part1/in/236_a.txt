Thanks for the insight guys.  I had actually already considered that somebody might have installed canti levers, but I haven't bothered to try and figure it out.  Though I probably should find out how to make the determination so I know whats in my parts bin (I'll google that next!).  I guess I just didn't bother because I knew at the very least I would need to swap out the levers, and I should install new cables at the same time.  I also need new brake pads, and since I am going that far I might as well slap on some top notch brake arms while I am it (since they are cheap at the moment).  If nothing else I just want to find out how well a highly rated V-brake system can perform, for curiosity sake as much as anything else.
