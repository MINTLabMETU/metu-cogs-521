I don't think it's this, since it looked as if it was already all the way forward in the slot from the start. (With the slack at least now I know I  can  easily remove the wheel, should I have to!  )

I don't actually know, I'll have to check. I got the chain from Peter, already on the bike. When it's time to change the chain (and I'll get my ruler out tonight!) then it sounds like a BMX chain is the way to go.
