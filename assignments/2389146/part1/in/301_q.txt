Just curious, is their a weight limit for the Swift?  Is it different for the aluminum and steel versions?

A buddy of mine is looking for a folding bike to "dilly dally" on but is at least 245 lbs.

Sorry to ask, but I did a few searches "rider weight limit", "rider weight", and "weight limit" but could not find an answer.  I was unable to find anything on the Xootr or Swiftfolder websites.
