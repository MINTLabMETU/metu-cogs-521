Actually, 150mm spacing would solve a lot of problems for many bicycles, which is popular with DH bikes and old skool FR bikes. I don't think Boost offers any real advantage up front, unless you are into a fat, or mid-fat bikes. I've also been a big fan of high volume 26" wheels, but I'm 5'8" so it's just a better all round compromise for me. If I had a choice, that's what it would be, along with more modern geometry and slightly longer wheelbase than what was standard for 26. I'm a "playful" rider most of the time, and 26 offers quite a bit more control in most situations... I have to work pretty hard to throw my current bike around. As someone said, it's slightly too long and tall...
