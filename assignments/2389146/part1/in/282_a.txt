Thanks for the excellent reply. And 'how to' pictures are always good too!

New details emerge seeing the details - like - the little brass washers you've threaded onto the spokes to sit between the flange and the spoke head. I've not seen that before - it is to protect the flange holes or for some other reason - either way it looks rather nice. I love that sort of detailling. I also see you've wired and soldered the crosses. That must be a pretty bombproof wheel for so few spokes. 

Thanks for the link to the freewheels!
Have been looking for lower-toothed myself. Will all these fit on a normal track flip-flop hub?
