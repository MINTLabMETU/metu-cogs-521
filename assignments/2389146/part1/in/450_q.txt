I just got an NS today.  I was a bit concerned that I would not fit as I am 6', 32 pant, 36 sleeve.  The bike looks great!  And it will fit me fine.  I can't believe that I can get a folder built this nice for the money spent.  I will have to take it out for a ride in the next couple of days - dicey this time of year in Michigan.  I bought this bike to run around my town on short hops and I think it will suit my purposes just fine.  GREAT PRODUCT MAKES FOR A HAPPY CUSTOMER!
