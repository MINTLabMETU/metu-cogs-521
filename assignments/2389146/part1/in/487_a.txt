I bought a similarly-specced* Birdy new-old-stock off eBay for $1,000 in 2008, so it does seem a bit pricey for what it is. (*Well, mine had a 9-speed Capreo setup and a fixed stem, so it wasn't identical).

On the plus side - that one has the adjustable stem. I'm tall (6'4") and one of the reasons I sold mine in the end was that the non-adjustable stem was just too low for me and I couldn't find a replacement here in the US.

Also, although drivetrain parts are available, as Bruce said, it can be hard to find 18" tires. I haven't looked lately, but choice was extremely limited last time I checked.
