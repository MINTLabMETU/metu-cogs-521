I was hoping some here could hep me with a tire question.
I currently have Primo Comet 20 x 1.35 tires on my Swift.  I like them but I have had a couple flats in the past year (I do about 100 miles weekly in Brooklyn and Manahattan) - and now I have decided that I want seomthing a little tougher.  From reading this forum, it seems the Big Apples are the way for me to go.
So here is my question.  Do I need Big Apples that are the same exact size (20 x 1.35) - or will my rims fit a wider tire?
