Titanium isn't generally used for big stuff like the airframe or skin...at least on no plane I ever worked on.  (Back in the day, it was all aluminum.)  TI is typically used for higher temp applications, eg, jet engine exhaust flow control, where individual parts aren't large. 

 (TI is used more extensively in the SR-71, which had friction heated wings at mach 3 speeds.  Many assemblies were loose at room temperature cuz operating dimensions were only achieved at much higher in-flight temps.  But one can make big things with rivets, which can make very strong assemblies.  And gas shielded welding works better with simply shaped parts.)
