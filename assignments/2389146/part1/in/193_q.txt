Long time rider, new here tho... Greetings

I'm dredging this thread up from last decade...

I was an early adopter of 29" back in '06. A Gary Fisher 292. Great bike, I still have it and am in the midst of doing a few upgrades to it.

Recently I came onto a good deal on a Pivot 5.5. Fun bike with 27.5. Running 2.5 front and 2.4 rear it has quite a different personality than the 292.

In my personal arsenal there are several roadbikes, a town bike or two, a commuter bike, a couple or more vintage bikes of various types, a fixed gear, a Sturmey Archer 3 speed fixed gear (don't even ask..;-) a tandem... and the 292 and 5.5 Pivot.

I enjoy them all, but to answer this question as honestly as I am able based observation in this area of northern Nevada-

I think the e-bike is going to make pedal power bikes obsolete faster than any wheel size factor.

There, I said it! We are all invested in an obsolete tech going the way of the 8 track and rotary phone. hahahah

In my area I talk to three different bike shop owners and they are selling the heck out of them. I also am seeing an apparent mental shift of buyers. Our local craigslist is packed with bikes that are seeming incredibly cheap, given the level of quality. $4-6K e-bikes are flying out the doors at these shops because why spend 4K on a bike that has to be pedaled hard vs the same amount or a bit more on a well built e-assist. Granted that tech is changing faster than anything, but you know how it is with all things of that nature..

Myself and Linda we rode e-bikes for a week in Belgium and I have to admit it's quite intoxicating. I'm afraid to ride one on our trails here because I'm pretty sure I would like it. But I'm not yet ready to give up what I enjoy about pedaling my own weight around. Plus, if I bought one I'd have to get one for Linda too...
