I thought you discovered that the silent clutch had 36 points?  At anyrate, are those available for 9sp?  I thought they were only compatible with 8sp bodies.  Also as I understand it, those things used plastic and rubber parts inside and were horrible for durability.  They were spec'ed on a lot of police bikes.
