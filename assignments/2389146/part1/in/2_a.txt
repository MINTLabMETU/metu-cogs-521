I haven't rode a tri bike before but I have been told they can be a little unstable if your not used to it.  As far as the group goes, find the approximate year of the bikes. Google search them and use images to narrow down the exact year by comparing colors and graphics on the frame. From there use bikepedia to verify the original group. If you are traveling far to see it ask for pics of each component, if there are reluctant to share there is probably good reason and you shouldn't by from them.
