Much like this thread the debate will never die.

Though I have upgrade question about the two. 

Backstory: I'm newer to the off road side of cycling and have a '04 Frankenbike that is slowly becoming a monstercross/rigid single track bike. My levers are a Shimano 105 9speed and a Cane Creek SCR-5.  It currently has generic no label Shimano Cantilevered brakes with kool stops 

BUT In my spares bin I have both upgraded Cantis (Avid Shorty 6) and V brakes (Avid Single digit 3r).  I like the modulation of the cantis and have only found myself wanting more power on the steepest of descents.  I realize that I will need travel agents if I go to v brakes but I want to pick up the wide cable hangers if I stick with cantis so I can move to a 40c tire so it is a bust on price.  Both need new pads again even on cost.

I am at a total loss about which one to go with...even after reading all 15 years of this thread, please help.
