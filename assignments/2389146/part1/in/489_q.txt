From the specs, looks to be a Mk2 Birdy . they made it to the US around 2008 .. the Mk3 Birdy 2015 ..Mk3 has disc brakes and redesigned front fork.. so the bike in Fremont is most likely something a few years old, but NOS .. Support in the US for a Birdy is pretty dismal at the moment .. If you wanted a MK3 Birdy, you might have to order direct from Pacific Cycles ... that being said, a Birdy is a great riding small wheel bike.. most of the drivetrain parts are generic, so that's not an issue in the US... there are plenty of aftermarket bits from Asia ..
