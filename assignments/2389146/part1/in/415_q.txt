This is my first post here. I have a Downtube VI and a Downtube VIII, the older version, with just the frong supension, and a 1996 Trek comfort bike. I really love the Downtube bikes. I was going to put out the money for a Dahon, but the reach between the seat and the handlebar is just too far for me to be comfortable no matter how high or low I put the bar. And the Downtube is a much better value. I'm glad I didn't get the Dahon because it would just be sitting aroun unridden.

The VI is a blast to ride. I replaced the 14-28 freewheel with a 13-34 for the hills around here. But it was just too heavy for me to lug arounf with my back problems, so I got a VIII when they came out.

Other than putting some blinkie lgihts and a handlebar bag on it, the only modification is a bunch of parts from various places sitting in a box. I have a SRAM X7 9-spped drivetrain with a 11-34 cassette ready to install, but I probably won't do it until spring. 

For anyone getting a downtube, I would advise going for the 9-spped option as I couldn't do it for $30 even with getting everything on sale (the shifter, derailleur, cassette and chain from various auctions and sales came to about 90 bucks), and who knows when you might need that extra gear because of big hills or getting older (I'm sixty and overweight).

My question is, and maybe Yan knows this, if I buy a Mini and the handlebar height is wrong for me, can I remove the whole folding stem assembly from the VI and fit it on the Mini, or would it not fit? 

Also, as I understand it the hub only comes with a 23- or 25-tooth cog, and I wonder which the mini has? 

And one other, I really do want an internal hub bike for around here (north of Seattle) so if I didn't get the Mini, do you have any ideas on lowering the gearing on the larger hub bike? The gearing is just way too high for me.

Thanks
