Sorry, I don't have a pic of the bike folded with the rack in situ as I have now removed it!  I have been experimenting with various options since I bought my Swift and have settled on the Carradice SQR system which allows the fitting of an SQR bag or (with optional bracket) a conventional saddle bag.  It allows a variety of luggage possibilities without getting in the way of the fold as the bags can be removed very quickly.  The rack  sat nicely above the rear wheel without much hang-over at all.  I also think it looked OK.  It's the hight of the rack above the wheel that affects the fold.  The closer to the wheel the rack is the closer to the seat post it goes when folded and this can stop the seat post dropping all the way.  The one I had allowed the seat post to drop nearly all the way, certainly enough to hold the bike together.
I do have some pics of the bike with the rack in place but they are too big to post on this site.  If I can fathom out how to reduce them I will display them!
