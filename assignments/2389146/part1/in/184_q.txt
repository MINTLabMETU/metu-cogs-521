This conversation relates to complete bikes being sold by all bike manufacturers.

26" wheels and their components...yes you can still purchase all of that from online bike stores such as Jenson etc. But you will be hard pressed to find any of the major mountain bike companies selling a 26" mountain bike.

So yes...26" is dead. The 26" offerings out there are limited to department store bikes which are junk. I have a 27.5" mtb which is starting to show its age, and I have started looking for a replacement. (without a hurry)
It might be just me, but it looks like 27.5" is going to have same fate as 26"? All the new mountainbikes seem 29"...

I'm a bit hesitant of switching to a 29'er, because of the slight loss of manoeuvrability (perhaps nothing to be worried about?)
