My frame failure was due to an error in the machining of the lower seat tube...it was actually honed off-center, leaving one side of the tube thinner than the other. This problem has been rectified in later model Swifts (I bought my original Swift in 2005). I checked the wall thickness of the seat tube on my new Swift with calipers, and the tube is perfectly concentric (my old one measured a mm or so thinner on the cracked side). The re-designed Swift will have a new seat tube with a thicker wall for added strength. ETA for this new frame has not yet been announced. 

I'm very confident in the current Swift frame for 3 reasons: 1.) Peter, Steve, and Karl have been very proactive with my frame issue (thanks again, guys) 2.) I unknowingly rode my Swift for over a week with the cracked seat tube, with a fully loaded messenger bag on SF's pothole-infested streets without any hint of a problem except for a slight creaking sound in the frame whenever I was out of the saddle 3.) All Xootr Swift frames come with a lifetime warranty. You really have nothing to worry about.  

As for the brakes, since you're going to drop bars, just keep the stock V-brakes and go with Dia Compe 287-V "Ã†ro" road levers (designed for V-brakes). Yangmusa has a set on his Swift. PM him for details.
