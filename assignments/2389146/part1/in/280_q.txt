 Zepi - your Swift is a really sublime ride. Lovely choice of components - nothing shouty but impressive to those that know. Can I ask if it's a fixie or freewheel? If the former you should get it posted to the fixed gear gallery. Also - care to elaborate on your trick 24/36 spoking on the front. Did you fill the unused holes with anything?
