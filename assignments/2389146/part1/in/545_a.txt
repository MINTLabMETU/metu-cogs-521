you kind of  your own question.

And industry inc. tire and rim makers don't make competitive 26" stuff anymore that is not lower end. They settled on 27.5 for small wheels... the thing is, it is only 8mm larger than 26. Lol. They could literally have used 26 as the small wheel option and no one would have noticed performance difference to 27.5.
