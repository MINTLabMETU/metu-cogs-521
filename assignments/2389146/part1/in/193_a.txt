Welcome to the forum. I think you're right about the bikes. Out of 3 bikes I have, one is an ebike. It's a fat tire ebike I use around town. I love riding the bike. My wife has an ebike as well and loves it. I don't see replacing my Rock Mountain Altitude with a MTB ebike anytime soon but I would love to ride an upper end MTB ebike on some big trails.
