Thanks for the advice.  It's back to the drawing board and eBay to hunt for a front derailleur.  The seat tube seems to be a standard size so I should be able to find one.

Good luck on your VIIIH.  I debated a long time between the hub gear and derailleurs.   I chose derailleurs because I knew I wanted to tinker with the bike.  Heck, it's part of the fun.  I am probably going to get the VIIIH for my mother-in-law, who drives a VW convertible (at my recommendation).  A decent riding folder would be just the ticket for her given the small trunk and back seat.
