Is $1,500 for the MK2 overpriced or is that a fair price after all these year it's been out?  It's advertised as new and the guy on the phone said it's on sale.  He also said there's one left.  Seems like the MK3 Birdy is $1,850 and is sold at Nycewheels in New York.  The store in Fremont is an official dealer but not Nycewheels according to the Birdy site, not sure if this makes a difference.  


Birdy Standard 9 Speed Â– NYCeWheels.com

Since Fremont is an official dealer they should have all the parts available that is needed for any part of the bike including the 18 inch wheels?  
The store in Fremont also has this Birdy classic for $1,500
