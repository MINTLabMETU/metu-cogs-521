FYI The current BB is a huge upgrade from the 2006 model. I would wager that our BB is one of the nicest you will find on a folder in our price range. Our bikes have weaknesses, I have been removing them as fast as possible.....too fast is risky for the company. We will retain the current BB's through 2007.

Thanks,
Yan
