Buy a "Nashbar Bike Transport Bag", currently $35 (less the usual 10% to 15% promo code, plus shipping), and address the length you don't need by sewing, heat-weld, rollup, zip-ties (cable ties), etc.  I use the zip-tie method:  melt two or three holes where you want to roll up the excess for a folder, zip-tie rolled up excess.  If you need the extra room in the bag for clothing, gear, etc., use the full length of the bag.  

Extra step One:  silk-screen "Steiermark Maler Staffelei" (Styria artist easel) on the side to keep the transit police asleep.  
Extra step Two:  wear a beret when boarding the train.  
Extra step Three:  finger-paint a mountain landscape on the bag; avoid bright colors.  
(I haven't needed the extra steps.)
