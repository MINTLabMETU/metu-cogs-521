Newbie, so not sure where best to post this.  Looking to buy a bike, I am 45 years old, 5'10" 200lb, looking to get in some cardio work by cycling, I am looking at a few used bikes and one new one, wondering which way to go.  Anyone got any suggestions on which one of these would be the best choice?

Thanks
