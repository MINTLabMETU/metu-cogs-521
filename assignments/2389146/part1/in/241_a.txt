Tektro Oryx have a beyond 90° angle in them, which is why they suck. Cantis with more than 90° angle don't have much mecanical leverage nomatter how you adjust them, or use v-brake levers. None of the 180° designs I've ever worked with ever stopped too much better than old mtb style stampsteel side pulls.

Yep I jumped off the bridge with the rest of you.
