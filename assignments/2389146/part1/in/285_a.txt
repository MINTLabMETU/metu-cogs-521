I am really interested in a fine bag for my swift. I want to get in and out of the austrian train without discussing if this is a bike or not.
There are some dahon-bags available at ebay, but I would like to avoid getting one just to find out that it doesn't fit with my swift. I think about sewing one out of two of those big IKEA-bags myself...  

Any suggestions?
