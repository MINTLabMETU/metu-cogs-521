Hi James and owners of other Nifty Swifties

Sharp eyes! The cache of bikes is owned by myself and my partner; besides the Bike Friday, there's also a Birdy.  The problem with both is in the quick folding; with the Bike Friday Pocket Rocket Pro, folding tends to throw the derailleurs out of whack.  Alex Wetmore's articles sent me down the Swift Folder path.  Here's the pics you asked for.  The crankset details are in my original post on page 33.
