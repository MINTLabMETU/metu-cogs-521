There is some some  merit in raising a flag. I get the humorous notion of sandwiches  and, umm, pop bottles strewn about but even slobs would have thrown them just out of view. Nevertheless, certainly a gritty look would be more  "realistic" for the purpose of showing how diligently the team has been  working non-stop.

A careful studio photo means the bike  used had been ready for some time before which would put into question  the timing of the announcement if only to purposely coincide with the holiday  season cheer. If indeed there is a facade, the test bike wasn't quite  ready. It may have been "close enough" to provide good news.

Further  in that line of reasoning, if one takes the bother to get a studio  portrait of a for all intent and purposes production-ready build, test completion notwithstanding, why not all configurations and numerous  angles, then put it up on the public website for all the world to see  including the pre-orderers in order to put them at ease, and  generate even more fervent interest among the undecided. Believe me, as  an internet software professional, it takes no more than a couple minute  to set up FTP (far less if the FTP software is preconfigured with  settings for the remote web server) and a few seconds additional to upload  even high res photos at speeds common nowadays.
