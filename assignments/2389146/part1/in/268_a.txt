Do you have the Kevlar comets? I've put over 500 miles (more than half of that mileage in downtown SF) on my 20x1.35 Kevlar Comets without a single puncture.

If you're looking for a durable city tire with more volume, then I'd recommend the 20x1.50 Kevlar Comets. They're 155 grams lighter than the Big Apples, and less rolling resistance. I find them much more comfortable for city riding than the 1.35. You lose a bit in acceleration due to the weight difference, but I find the rolling resistance to be on-par with that of the 1.35.
