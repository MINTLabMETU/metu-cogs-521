Helix bikes are welded inside an inert vacuum chamber to mitigate  problems working with titanium. What is puzzling though is there  cannot possibly be inert vacuum chambers large enough to accommodate  anything the size of $100M+ fighter jet aircraft.That means either (a)  inert vacuum chambers are not really necessary to effectively work with  titanium, or (b) the most sophisticated fighter jets have structural  integrity problems. Neither observations are consistent with all the  type about sub-sonic titanium bicycles.
