I have a 10 year old 26" mountain bike. It's my only mountain bike and it still works perfectly.

To be fair, I've wanted to replace it for some time, but when I look at the market I see no reason to do it. I just don't like what's available:
- I'd have to spend at least twice what my current bike cost to have a new bike with a similar weight.
- I just hate 1x. It lacks range compared to my triple, and the steps are huge. I just can't consider it.
- 2x is bearable, but still lacks range. I just don't get it.
- Most current bikes have crappy components compared to my bike, even if they cost twice what I paid 10 years ago.
- I've tried 29" and made zero difference on my ride times (not that I care), and felt like driving a bus.
- I hate modern ultrawide handlebars with a passion. Who designed that unergonomic crap? I know it's easy to cut them, but why do all modern bikes come with that POS? which also makes me wonder: why bar ends are out of fashion? they're ergonomic, give you multiple hand positions, wheight nothing and are really useful for XC... It seems to me that everything revolves around aesthetics now.

So here I am... as long as there are parts available and it doesn't break in half, I think I'm not going to replace it.
