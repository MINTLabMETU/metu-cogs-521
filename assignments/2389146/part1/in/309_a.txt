James, thanks for looking this up. I think I will go with the travel agents. I actually have a set on my full-size road-bike (it was originally a hybrid/touring bike I converted to drop-bar) since this solution will be less than the special road brakes you mentioned. I don't mind the travel agents, I was just trying to do the full "roadie" setup.

When I get the bike ordered and setup, I'll come back and post my results.

Thanks again.
