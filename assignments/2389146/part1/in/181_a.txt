You should have looked into that statement before making it, because it is not true.

Specialized, Trek, Giant, Santa Cruz, C-dale, Kona, Fuji, Salsa, All City, Jamis, ALL have 27+ compatible bikes NOT marketed as 29ers. In fact, in many cases the 27.5+/29er bikes are marketed as 27.5+ first. Pivot and Surly list 27.5+/27compatible ones as exactly that..They are NOT marketed first as 29ers.

So I don't know where you are getting your info from, here.

Again, there is zero evidence that they are being phased "out". Nearly every bike company is making them and marketing them as such. Just not as many a a few years ago. That is what is known as a "correction".

That is an empty argument. Sometimes prediction of doom are correct (like with 26") and sometimes they are not (like plus tires).

And that is fine, but "opinion" and  "guess" are the keys words. And that is important to note when you state (seemingly as fact) that Giant plans to phase out 27.5 in two years when you actually have zero information on that.
