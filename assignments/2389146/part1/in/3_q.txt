Buying a new road bike soon and the first thing I want to do is slap on some Continental Gatorskins on it. The wheels it comes with are cheap 700x23mm tires that warrant immediate replacement. 

My question, which has probably been asked a million times already.....do I get the Gatorskins in 700x23 or 700x25? From the little research I've done, it seems that there is no set in stone answer, every forum I've read just from typing in "700x23 vs 700x25" in google always ends up in a turd tossing flame war between those who are pro-23mm and pro-25mm. 

From my understanding, there has been a shift in the last few years in a pro scene where they're all dumping their 23mm's to go to 25mm's. Is this true? 

I only ride for fitness on a paved bike path so any info you provide me will help tremendously. I've come a long way since my last post in this thread, lol 11mph avg. What an out of shape joke I was.
