Hi, my first post here. 

I haven't owned a bike since childhood (I'm 30 now) and now I'm in the process of looking for a road bike model to buy. 

I found one I like at my local store, but it has no drop handlebars, which I really need for my riding. I know there are handlebars on sale on the web, but not sure if they would fit that bike. Do handlebars fit any bike, or if not, what are the technical specs to check if they will this bike model?

Thanks in advance.
