Dude wants to buy a new bike. Has a 27.5. Wonders if he should buy another. I know from your posting history the only thing that matters is "Is it expensive" "Is it popular" but as far as the OP is concerned, there is no problem buying another 27.5. I guess I'm just answering that question and not using the thread as another excuse for a well worn rhetorical response.

Straight up question: If one doesn't need to worry about parts, and it isn't about fanboy popularity issues - what point is there to worrying about whether a wheel size is "dead" or not. If you have the bike, and enjoy riding it, what is the effect upon your experience?
