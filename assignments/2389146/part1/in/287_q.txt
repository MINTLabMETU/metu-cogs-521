Extra step One:  silk-screen "Steiermark Maler Staffelei" (Styria artist easel) on the side to keep the transit police asleep.  
Extra step Two:  wear a beret when boarding the train.  
Extra step Three:  finger-paint a mountain landscape on the bag; avoid bright colors.  
(I haven't needed the extra steps.)
