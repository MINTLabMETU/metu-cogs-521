Sometimes "Simplify" is really Complicate....
I have a deep mistrust of internal geared hubs.
I love the "simplicity" of a derailleur system.
There is nothing "simple" about a birdy or your project.  You will only have one cable running to the back of the bike for your shifter but that is all.

The 3 gears on a 3 speed are not changeable to the ratios you want.
The extra weight and mechanical resistance you get from an IGH is not worth it to me compared to a simple 9 speed derailleur system.

For about the same price as your conversion you should be able to find a good used 7 speed IGH folding Dahon.

I have a 7 speed igh Dahon that I got for $200 used that is in nearly new condition.  It does not have the range of ratios I want.  I want at least a 90 high gear and at least a 30 low gear.

The 8 speed 11/30---52 on my Swift is perfect.
Heck for the price of your project you could buy a Swift new---almost.

You could easily buy a Dahon speed uno and play with it.  

I have only played with a few geared coaster brakes but I always felt they had a lot of drag.  I know the single speed coasters have way more drag than I want.
