Hello. I have been riding for a lot of years but mainly on suspensionless MTB chromoly with tarmac tyres and can't wait to get a road bike. But there are some tech questions, giving me a headache.
The LBS can offer me new bike with Shimano SORA, but for that money I can buy a second hand roadster with 105 5700 or Dura Ace 7400? My current bike is with Tourney/Acera setup and has no problems.
I do 300kms per week, sometimes short tourings, As far I read the upper gruppos last longer.Is it worth it to go upper level and built some set and forget setup? 

Thank you for your time.
