Hey NickyC,

You might get more/better responses if you post in the Clydesdales/Athenas sub-forum.

You don't mention your age, but unless you're over 75, riding a road bike shouldn't hurt, even at your weight/height.  I do think you might be making things hard on yourself by riding a bike with a racing geometry -- those are going to put more strain on your neck and back.  And you're going to get a pain in the butt if your saddle doesn't support your sit-bones properly.

Folks working their weight down often find it more pleasant to start on a hybrid, flat-bar road bike, or at least an endurance-geometry road bike.  But even the bike you have should be "bearable" with the proper fit and saddle... raising the handlebars (increasing the stack), shortening the stem, etc. should definitely help.

Talk with the Clydes -- they can give you good advice!

Good luck!
