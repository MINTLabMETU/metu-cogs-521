 Interesting and true.

"Mountain bikes" are popular because for most people, they are general utility bicycles, comfortable to ride while firmly seated on the wide-soft saddle, low-geared to take less effort to keep moving, comfortable with wide (and often underinflated) tires.

"Mountain biking" is unrelated. I don't know what fraction but I'd say a large percentage of people riding fat-tire bikes have never been "mountain biking" or "trail riding." Really riding an MTB takes full-body conditioning, coordination, and technique ...  and none of that comes in the first couple rides. 

Sure, someone who can ride a bike can clear some obstacles, but a steep climb on loose dirt with roots and a nine-inch step-up two thirds through, while nothing for most MTB riders, took this road rider a while to learn to clear.

I look forward to regaining my health and fitness sufficiently that I can go back out and embarrass myself on some Intermediate trails ...  after several rides on the Easy trails just to relearn the basic discipline.

I think most people who buy MTBs would be as scared to ride on a real MTB trail as they would be to ride on the road in urban traffic.

Fine with me. If they stay on the sidewalk, I don't run into them, on or off-road.
