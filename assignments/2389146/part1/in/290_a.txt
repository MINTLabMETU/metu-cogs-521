Ha! Yes, my Swift has multiple personality disorder.  The bars are oversize (31.8mm) MTB 1.5" riser bars mounted to a 10-degree 110mm oversize road stem. Although not as hardcore as the bullhorns, I find the risers much more comfortable and the extra leverage handy for fixed-gear city riding. They're stout, stiff, and light. I lopped off about 2.5 inches on each end with my $4 pipe cutter. 

Oh, and by the way, Xootr changed the headset on the bike. This one adjusts perfectly (no slop, no bind). I'm hoping it stays that way after miles of pounding on SF's pothole-ridden streets.
