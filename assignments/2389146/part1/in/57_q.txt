Just spent 3 hours of the afternoon riding my mountain bike. Verdict: I have no idea why anyone would want one of these things. You cannot get into the zone. You can't put down the power without being interrupted by some tree root or rock feature. There is the constant danger of falling over. I mean, I came to ride my bike, not constantly avoid falling over. Give me a road bike, please.
