Disagree. Since a mountain bike has much higher rolling resistance and worst aerodynamics, it takes more energy to maintain the same speed on a mountain bike versus a road bike.  Let's say going 20 mph on a road bike burns as many calories as going 15 mph on a mountain bike. Over a 20 mile course, you will burn more calories on the mountain bike covering the same distance. 

Think of it like a Chevette vs a Caddy. Both will cover the same distance but the Caddy burns more gasoline while giving you a more comfortable ride.
