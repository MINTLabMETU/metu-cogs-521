My Cargo Node failed in the same way about two months ago. I’m not allowed to post photos yet since I just joined, but here are some details:

Bike: Tern Cargo Node purchased May 2016 plus Bafang BBS02 mid drive kit

height. 5’2”

weight 112 lbs

riding surface in your area: mixed, but when it broke I was rolling across train tracks

bumpy? When it failed, yes, very, otherwise mixed

luggage? backpack, pannier(s), front bag, or: when it failed, I was carrying just myself, maybe 10 lbs of gear in the Leap bags plus the 14 lb motor/battery. Around 140 lbs.

typical weight of luggage: Around 90% of the time the load was less than 150 lbs. The other 10% of the time I carried luggage, kids, all kinds of stuff. I definitely approached the 350lb stated limit.

total mileage: around 5k miles

I’m a small rider and not very powerful. The BBS02 is rated at 750 watts. I nearly always used it on the 250 watt or 375 watt settings. When it failed I wasn’t pedaling or using the throttle, there were no forces on the drivetrain. I was rolling at about 8 mph over a set of really bumpy train tracks.
