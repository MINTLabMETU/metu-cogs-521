Thank you very much Badger1. Of course, I was never wrong, even slightly, and I never misunderstood anything .... and if what I actually typed indicates beyond any shadow of a doubt that I was wrong and misunderstood,  it is probably due to Russian hackers changing my posts.

My posts are Always the rigid MTBs of internet posts.

But thanks for being big enough to clear the air ---even if I know you only did it to make me look bad.
