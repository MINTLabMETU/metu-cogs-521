Still buying rims, tires and tubes for 27" wheelsets with no real problem with selection. This is 20+ yrs after the last mass produced bike was sold with 27" wheelsets. Happy Feet has it right, Who cares. 27.5"(650B) size tires, tubes, and rims will be available for decades after the last one was produced. 650B rims, tires and tubes have always been available in Europe and maybe elsewhere and got turned into 27.5" MTB wheelsets by creative bike marketers looking to get people to switch from the perfectly capable MTB's they had to the new Fashionable, Rational, and Oh So Very Much Better than that old outdated, unfashionable clunker you call a bicycle. Gets em every time and we now have 6 Billion dollars spent on bicycles in America instead of 5 Billion. Who says that fashion doesn't sell.
