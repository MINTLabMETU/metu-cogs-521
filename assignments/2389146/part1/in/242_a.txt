Well, I had a set on my Probe, and a pair ot 90Â° Origin8s on the back, and the bike stopped much better than tye Tektros, with the O8s.

I like cantis, I hate vbrakes, and often have more trouble with them with setup. I usually set them up with vbrake levers- wonderful stopping power

I did see a set of vbrakes I do like, they had a parallel system, like you see on transit bus windshield wipers, they moved in a  arc keeping the pads flat, instead of the normal swinging angle of conventional ones. As far as I'm concerned, it's cantis, or disc. I do like the bmx center pulls/ubrakes, but they only work on bmx bikes.
