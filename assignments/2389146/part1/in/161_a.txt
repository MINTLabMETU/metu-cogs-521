How about 36" or maybe the BMX 22" standard. My local Walmart is full of 26" wheeled bicycles. The fashion, excuse me, bicycle industry is having a hard time killing off the 26" bicycle. Much harder than the 27" wheeled 10 speeds of yore. Hey, maybe we will be going back to 27" after the 700c market gets saturated. Got to keep up with the Jones.
