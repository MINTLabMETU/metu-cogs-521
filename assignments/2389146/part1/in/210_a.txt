Not to flog a dead horse but to say a wheel size is no longer the industry norm is different from saying it is dead. At least to me.

For a product line to be dead means a. it is no longer made and/or b. it is no longer supported by parts or service. A good example would be a bike made using proprietary parts wherein the parent company closes shop. When that happens the product line can be said to be dead because it can't be purchased or repaired and has a finite lifespan.

That is why I mention parts. If you have a bike and it is supported by parts that product is not dead. It remains a viable option. It may not be the popular product line but it is not defunct.

I don't think smaller wheel sizes will go that route entirely because there are enough people of smaller stature who find 29" to be too large for them. The industry may move to marginalize them somewhat but won't entirely ignore that market pool.
