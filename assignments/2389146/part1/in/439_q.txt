My Mini is in the hospital.   

The bottom bracket was so stuck I couldn't budge it with an 18" breaking bar or an impact driver - this after letting it soak in liquid wrench (applied from both sides) for about an hour.  Hopefully, the LBS will be able to get it out without damaging the frame.

I hope to get it back this evening so I'll let you know how it turns out.

Yan - you might want to check on how these BBs are being installed at the factory.  On the non-drive side, which I was able to remove, there was only the slightest bit of grease / anti-seize on the threads.  Or, better still, you might want to spec the Shimano UN BB to start with.  I doubt that anyone would complain about a $10 price increase, especially when the alternative is early BB failure and then the hassle of trying to get the current one out.
