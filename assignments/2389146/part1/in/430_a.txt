Noooooooooooo!!  The 'weird coat hanger' is so much better since many times I don't have to adjust the seat - that way it will rest on that instead of the chain ring.

I'm actually playing around with magnets for a make-shift fix for that - will post when I get it working right!

Good to know about the fender braces!

I just put on a Suntour shifter instead of the grip shifter.  Ahhhhhhhhhh   It's not indexed but I find it much easier and quicker to shift.  I know some people love the grip shifters but I never did - back when they were in fashion, out, and now back in!

I also seem to remember that Yan mentioned a few pages back that they won't comment on the newer versions until they're out.
