You clearly have an elitist attitude dismissing just about everywhere in the world and all other price points which you have no interest in. The industry is surely a term that indicates all of the cycling industry across the whole globe. However I do understand the point that at retail in the US 27.5" is becoming far less important but that isn't a reflection of the industry that is a reflection of consumer demands in the US who buy higher end mountain bikes. Huge number of people buy and use Walmart bikes, there are simple practical bikes amongst the more ridiculous cheap dual suspension bikes. I personally don't see them as crap if people are riding them and enjoying them. On youtube you only have to look at channels like kevcentral to see a huge amount of people who love their walmart bikes even with their faults (depending on model).
