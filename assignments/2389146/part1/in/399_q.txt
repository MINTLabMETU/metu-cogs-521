The newsletter seems to be referring to that sent to people who requested to be kept updated, who are not backers but interested parties. So that would mean info suitable for the general public l am guessing. I now fall into that category after Surfhenk took over my backer position.

I am also guessing that the letter would coincide with the next update.
