Well, I have to say each time a person does that you will get interesting responses (that's if the forum doesn't expire threads).

This time 3 people got emotional, believing I was spamming the forum to increase my post count from 7 to 8. On a forum I don't go to.

I _was_ expecting someone to reply to the comment I was quoting of course, but you learn something new every day.

Peace.
