The Mauna Kea bike (DT FS frame) has an FSA crankset (branded as NB... sale price was about $80 IIRC).  I think I used a 68x108 BB because I would be on the large chain ring most of the time.  The FD works fine... but the FD cable path and cable stop is home brew, as you can see in the pix.  I thought about going without an FD, but I would be stopping to manually shift too often.  For hilly SF, I would mount an FD, YMMV.ã€€If I were going to be on the smaller ring more, I would use a 68x113.  Using the 68x108, I had to dremel the FD inner cage flange to get the 39/26 (Capreo) combination to work right.
