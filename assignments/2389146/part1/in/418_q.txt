I also noticed the rear wheel was much slower than the front wheel, when spun in open air - but I don't know whether this affects the bike when there's more weight on it. I think friction can have a sort of breaking point, so that once the force applied to moving the bike (through gravity, weight, inertia, etc) is strong enough, the force slowing the wheel down actually becomes less. It seems to me like the Mini can coast forever, when I'm riding it, but yes, it doesn't spin far in the open air.
