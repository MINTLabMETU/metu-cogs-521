Well, speed wasn’t my goal. I also got improved ride quality as the larger wheel rides over roots and logs better. Knowing that helps when you pick a line and I’m riding stuff that my FS would handle but my 26” HT has issues with. Attendant with a new bike is better tires that are tubeless and run much less air pressure, so less bounce off objects as well as a tire designed for that pressure, so better grip in turns and while climbing. And 1X which has a terrific range for where I ride and makes it easier not dealing with when to front shift. Plus improved geometry which makes the 29’er a killer climbing bike. And wider bars that help with control.

You can retro a lot of this into a 26” wheeled bike, and if I had a really light and good carbon 26” bike, I could see doing tubeless/1X/wide bars/etc.... and I’d bet it would be a great bike, but sometimes it’s cost effective to go to a new bike.
