  Well, the biggest problem I seem to be having with that particular model, is that I don't think I will fit on it.  The max height is 6'2" and well, I happen to be 6'4".  I have tested other folding bikes, and I just can't get proper leg extension on it because the seat tube is just a hair too short.  So I have been thinking about the DT Full Suspension bike.  It clearly states it's for the bigger/taller riders so I figured I would ask a question to anyone who might know the answer or offer a suggestion.  (sorry for the long intro)
