What is the real benefit of 24"wheels ?  Smaller wheel roll as well and there is a much wider choice of tires in 20" ETRTO496 than in 24" ETRTO507.  There are no high performances road tires in 24" ETRTO507.

You can also consider the https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/v...bike-bicycle#/  The creators already sell the Vellobike and there are also nu-assisted and titanium frame version.  
The chance of success of the Vellobike+ seems much bigger (and faster) than the one of Helix.
