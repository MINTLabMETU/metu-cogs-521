Not your thread but... I thought it was about the OP's concern regarding possible maneuverability issue going to 29 instead of 27.5  worrying about replacing a worn out bike with a new one in the near future. They have 27.5, seems like they like 27.5, but are worried 27.5 might go away by then.

It seems 27.5 is still available in the near future and we can assume after that the concern is about finding parts for that bike. If 26 is any guide, there should be ample parts to fix it down the road.

The maneuverability issue really depends on the rider size. If they are larger probably no problem but if they are smaller in stature they may find 29 to be a bit much to push around.

Here's the OP - let's confirm:
