Thanks for posting. 
Have you considered getting a Birdy? It's German designed and you can swap out the 18" wheels for 20" (406).  They are difficult to find in the US but should not be a problem for you and would be a good alternative. 

Now I'm worried about the two Terns I have.  I do have one Birdy and it's been great.
