Sorry, all I can remember about cantilevers on my two vintage bikes that have cantilever brakes is that one needed a new semi custom fork and the other project was never completed. For some reason, older touring and cyclocross bikes had cantilever posts that were installed with very narrow center distances of 55mm. More recent bikes with cantilevers have much wider post centers. I never did find brakesets with the right geometry for older steel bikes. I literally had a fork built with modern post center distances so that I could use a modern cantilever  brakeset.
