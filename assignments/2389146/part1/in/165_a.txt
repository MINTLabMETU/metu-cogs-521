sorta agree with the no need for boost front, but for thicker stanchions like 36s and 40s you can get much bigger tires up front. I have a Fox Factory 36 on my Scott FR710 and don't think I can get larger than a 2.5 in the front. I'm running 2.4s HR2s now which we all know Maxxis tend to size smallish.

also no way the industry not going to use an old "standard".  That's just not profitable....  Sorry Mr Bike Mfr, I'm not buying into super boost.  Actually my favorite setup is an 11spd with 142TA.  I haven't needed Eagle yet.  Though the idea of an e-bike for commuting has me interested.
