Perhaps you are scope-locked on mountain bikes with dual suspension, knobby tires, and wide bars.  Yes this is one type of MTB but there are many being ridden on road that have no suspension, smooth tires, and short bars.  My aluminium Giant Yukon is of this latter type, I run smooth 26 x 1.65" tires at 75 PSI on it, and while the ride might not be as harsh as that experienced on a racer it has good road characteristics.  Add SPD pedals and shoes, raise the seat to the optimum height and you have a great roadie.  Of course having MTB strength I can go seamlessly from road to rocky ground in pursuit of the most practical path.  

Most cyclists on road are of the opinion that because the law says they have the right to be there they are inherently safe there.  I don't hold that view myself, I think you are safe when you are safe but when you bike can only handle smooth road, what choice do you have
