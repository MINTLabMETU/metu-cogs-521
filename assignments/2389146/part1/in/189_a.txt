I really enjoy rebuilding older bicycles.  This usually means new parts including wheelsets, handlebars, cranks, headset, you name it.  I like doing my own work and build my own wheels.  This is not for everyone but doing a rebuild/parts replacement can be cheaper than replacing with a new bicycle.  Usually you can upgrade components and still be cheaper than a new bicycle.  If you cannot do your own work then having an estimate done for the mechanics time and parts cost should factor in any decision whether to rebuild or replace your bicycle.  MTB's wear their components much faster than street bikes because of all the dirt that gets in everywhere.  Hubs and crank bearings are especially wear prone as are the whole chain and derailleur/cassette/sprocket assemblies.  Some types of shifters are prone to wear/breaking while others are dead reliable.  Just another avenue to think about when contemplating the replacement of your present steed.
