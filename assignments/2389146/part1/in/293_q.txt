Considering, that the Swift Folders thread is one of the most frequented threads in the Folding Bike Forums, and things are getting a little jumbled: wouldn't it be a good idea to expand and create a plain swift-folder-gallery thread. I love to watch images of nice, customized swift machines...  And maybe even more swift lovers will upload their images then. I simply can not get enough of those images.
