This is my first post here. I have a Downtube VI and a Downtube VIII, the older version, with just the frong supension, and a 1996 Trek comfort bike.

My question is, and maybe Yan knows this, if I buy a Mini and the handlebar height is wrong for me, can I remove the whole folding stem assembly from the VI and fit it on the Mini, or would it not fit? 


Thanks
