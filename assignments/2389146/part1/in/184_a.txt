Well, let's go back top the original question:

This person can go out tomorrow and buy a brand new 27.5 bike. It will last for years (hopefully) and they will have no problem buying parts. Why worry if it is "dead"? How would that effect this rider in any way? It's a non starter question and supposition - just something people say because they like to pronounce things.

What does anyone get out of stating certain bikes are dead? What is the pay off unless you are buying stocks in future 27.5 bicycle sales? In a world where you can buy just about any style off the shelf or get a builder to make whatever you want (as you just suggested to the OP in the 29r dropbar thread) such statements seem limited to those viewing bike ownership as a popularity contest and are afraid of being caught on the wrong side of fashion.
