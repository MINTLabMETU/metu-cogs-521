This is the last change I will make to my Swift - until the next one!  Fitting a rear rack turned out to be easier than I thought.  I had an old mountain bike rack lying in the shed and it looked as though it would fit my Swift without affecting the folding system.  It is not a special rack for small wheeled bikes and I think any commercially available rack will fit the bill.  I used the fittings from another touring rack, which featured flat and fairly flexible "arms", to attach the rack to the rear wheel stays.  The upper arms bend quite easily and can be bolted to the Swift using plastic covered 'P' clips.  The graceful curve in the arms add some stiffness and solidity to the rack and it does not interfere with the folding much at all.  The width between the bent "arms" may prevent the seat pillar sliding all the way down but it should still slide far enough to contact the rear wheel to keep the bike together.  Each rack may be different in that respect. If you want to fit a rack then I think any mountain bike or touring rack which uses flat "arms" will do the job.  My completed rack feels very secure and is the perfect home for my AGU rack top bag.  This bag has small panniers which fold out from its side but still keep clear of my heels (size 10 shoes - UK size).  I would not like to try heavy camping gear on it, but for general use it works well.
