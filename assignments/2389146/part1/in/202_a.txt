Actually it is the discussion here. An inanimate object can't literally be dead so there is some sort of inference

What does it mean to say a certain wheel size is "dead"? Does it mean there are no longer parts to service that size, making it obsolete? Or does it mean it is no longer the industry "norm".

If the first, that is incorrect. If the second, who cares what the industry norm is., unless one wants to appear fashionable by ensuring one is riding what everyone else is riding ie. a slave to current fashion trends.

Shorter people often find 29rs to large and 27.5 is a proven design so I imagine it will be around for a while to come. Perhaps just not as the current fashion leader.
