I apologize, the bike I should compare to is not the ocr1, but the tcr1.  Still not apples to aples, but it is an aluminum framed bike.
Thanks for the replies.  I have a lot to consider before I start shelling out the cash.
I guess I was trying to see if the swift would compare to a Bike Friday.  Where all I read and hear about those bikes, is how awesome they are. And how they can easily replace someones true road bike.  I have inquired about the fridays as we'll, and the number one turn off is the price. Second, is when I asked about turning it into a fixed gear bike, the contact person @ BF advised against it, and said its not practical and would be difficult to do.  Although I have seen BF's as fixed bikes.
From everything I have read about the swift, I am sure it would be a capable platform for me to turn it into what I want.  And what I am after is first and foremost a compact package of a bike that performs well.  I'm not looking to reduce my stable of bikes by having an all in one package of a bike, but to expand my collection to have a sweet folding bike that would be able ride with the big boys if needed.
Man this is getting long winded.
Oh, one last thing. I don't know anything about braze on front derailers, but is that even a consideration to get a FD onto the swift?
