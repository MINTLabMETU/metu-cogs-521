I would agree about the better V's compared to the low end discs.  However, not in the snow or rain.  Water is the enemy of rim brakes, all rim brakes.  If you're planning on doing a lot of snow riding, discs are the best bet.  If $$$ is an issue, try salmon colored koolstop pads in your Vs.  They work best under wet conditions and do make a difference.  BTW, nice looking Rockhopper.  We still have my 05, I'm saving it for my son when he returns from Europe.
