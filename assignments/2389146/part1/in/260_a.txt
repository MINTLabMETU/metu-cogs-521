Yeah, if you can put the chain back on "really easily", then the chain is too slack. Check for chain stretch, but before you do, check to make sure your rear hub hasn't slid forward in the track ends (Swifts don't have drop-outs). Also, check for chain alignment. I've let my chain run really slack on my fixie for a while, and never had it drop (my chainline is within ~1mm of dead-on). 

Also, what kind of chain do you have (8sp or single?). I've stretched through a PC-68 chain on my SS pretty quickly. I find that  are much more durable and are far less prone to drop than multi-speed chains.
