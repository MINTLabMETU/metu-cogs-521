This is somewhat true. But I find the knee jerk reaction to declare bikes "dead" to be more internet mumbo jumbo phrasing than anything else. Especially when the poster I'm having the back and forth with has a penchence for declaring sized dead, bikes as BSO's or always suggesting one simply buy another bike. Apparently 26" has been dead for a long time now but I still manage to get out and ride two of them on a regular basis. Still get parts, still get tires.
