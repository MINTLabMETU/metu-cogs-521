Rookie myself.  I'm thinking if the wobble is caused by rims needing to be trued or bad bearings.  I don't think truing is major but don't know about bearing replacement.  On second set of wheels you would need to get a rear wheel with a cassette.  Might be more costly.  Like I said. a rookie here.  Just my thoughts.
