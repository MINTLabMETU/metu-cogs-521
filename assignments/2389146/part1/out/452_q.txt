well the biggest problem seem having with that particular model is that dont think will fit it. the max height is and well happen. have tested other folding bikes and just cant get proper leg extension it because the seat tube is just hair too short. so have been thinking about the DT Full Suspension bike. it clearly states its for the biggertaller riders so figured would ask question anyone who might know the answer or offer suggestion. sorry for the long intro
