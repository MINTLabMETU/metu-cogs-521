same distance similar intensity sure doull burn more calories the bike that makes the exercise take longer. thats not how people tend plan rides though if Im faster bike and intend similar sort of workout Ill likely go faster and farther. if anything riding like-for-like roads Im more likely get good workout the road bike since Ill have the happy incentive of greater sense of speed and seeing more things. if trail riding gets thrown into the mix things get more complicated
