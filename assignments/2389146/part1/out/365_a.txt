two years is NOT weird if your starting new tech bike company from scratch. from what it seems now the BIGGEST problem holding Helix back is that they are dependent contractors for making certain proprietary parts. thats supposedly what is delaying the test bike and backer bikes now. hopefully in the near future ALL frame parts will manufactured inhouse. no one will have problem if stuff like wheels spokes tubes brakes derailleurs etc. are imported. however ibm all for getting rameses anyways. can get my own components
