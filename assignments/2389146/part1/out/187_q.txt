realise this is focused forum so from the perspective that the retail market specialist bike shops are gradually reducing bikes correct but should extend that out the world where the European market different and buys mores bikes and mountain bikes still dominate in China with much larger sales. also seems unfair completely dismiss the lower priced bikes wal-mart amazon etc many of which are used for leisure use and very easy trails which are dominated by bikes. most of my bikes are older mountain bikes must admit but then Im not serious offloaded just like explore the country side and like buy bikes pretty cheaply
