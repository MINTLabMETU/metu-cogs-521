not flog dead horse but say wheel size is no longer the industry norm is different from saying it is dead. least me. for product line dead means. it is no longer made and/or. it is no longer supported by parts or service. good example would bike made using proprietary parts wherein the parent company closes shop. when that happens the product line can said dead because it cant purchased or repaired and has finite lifespan. that is why mention parts. if you have bike and it is supported by parts that product is not dead. it remains viable option. it not the popular product line but it is not defunct. dont think smaller wheel sizes will go that route entirely because there are enough people of smaller stature who find too large for them. the industry move marginalize them somewhat but wont entirely ignore that market pool
