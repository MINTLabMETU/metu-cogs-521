sometimes Simplify is really Complicate. have deep mistrust of internal geared hubs. love the simplicity of depailler system. there is nothing simple about birds or your project. you will only have one cable running the back of the bike for your shifter but that is all. the gears speed are not changeable the ratios you want. the extra weight and mechanical resistance you get from high is not worth it me compared simple speed depailler system. for about the same price as your conversion you should able find good used speed high folding damon. have speed high damon that got for used that is in nearly new condition. it does not have the range of ratios want. want least high gear and least low gear. the speed my Swift is perfect. heck for the price of your project you could buy Swift newalmost. you could easily buy damon speed uno and play with it. have only played with few geared coaster brakes but always felt they had lot of drag. know the single speed coasters have way more drag than want
