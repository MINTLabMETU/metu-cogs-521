so my first cantbrakes were my Trek and they were fine in. being Clydesdale and riding in the wet wet Pacific Northwest as mostly commuter but sometimes loaded camper brake weight was never my concern. have similar vintage Raleigh Aleyeska touring bike with Paul motility brakes which are amazing. use tero road lever for brake pull. disks were definite improvement some bikes. have recumbent Easy Racers Titanium Gold Rush running spoke rear with magic ceramic rim and caliper brake which stops well. recently bought bike with XT hydraulic discs that setup is nicer ride than Avid bit is Nazca Fuego. it is again case of different strokes preferred by different folks. weight important or not. rim wear important or not. online brake levers important or not. but brakes have definitely improved since the start of this thread. wants brakes or neither. is where this ancient thread has moved. if it is wants vs V Ill take Paul monoliths but Ive never used Paul hants.
