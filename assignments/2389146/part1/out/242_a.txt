well had set my Probe and pair ot a Origin the back and the bike stopped much better than tye tetras with the. like santis hate brakes and often have more trouble with them with setup. usually set them up with brake levers wonderful stopping power did see set of brakes do like they had parallel system like you see transit bus windshield wipers they moved in keeping the pads flat instead of the normal swinging angle of conventional ones. as far as Im concerned its santis or disc. do like the bmx center pullsubrakes but they only work bmx bikes
