thanks really like my Rockhopper. just bought it off craigslist month or so ago and it had hardly been ridden. it is solid bike that seems up taking beating. really think would have pay about as much get something of comparable quality new. am sure your son will have fun with yours. the brakes however seem the only weak link mine. think in part it because somebody replaced the original levers with some generic unknown make and model. guess they did it as byproduct of upgrading the shifters. have set the pads ridiculously close the rims have reasonable brake lever pull. the brakes themselves are low end shamans and seem have adjust them after every ride. so decided just get of the whole braking system and start over. my original plan was find some decent used disk wheels and buy new Avid BB and new levers. which would have cost for everything. but in researching all that came across so many glowing reviews of the Avid V brake system which could had about the price and they are much lighter that decided give Vs one more shot. it is mostly dry weather here though it has been snowy couple weeks and try not let the snow stop me if have time ride
