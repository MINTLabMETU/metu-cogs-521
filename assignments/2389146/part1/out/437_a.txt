thought this was really good idea. so manually copied all the tml pages and saved it my hard drive clunky way do it but best could do short notice. did the same for Waveshrdrs reviews of the viii and Mini. ill try back them up periodically. this information is too valuable for newcomers. if anyone wants copy of these pages let me know
