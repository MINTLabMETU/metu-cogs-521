disagree. since mountain bike has much higher rolling resistance and worst aerodynamics it takes more energy maintain the same speed mountain bike versus road bike. lets say going mph road bike burns as many calories as going mph mountain bike. over mile course you will burn more calories the mountain bike covering the same distance. think of it like Chevette vs Caddy. both will cover the same distance but the Caddy burns more gasoline while giving you more comfortable ride
