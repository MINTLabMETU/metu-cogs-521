got mine and threw it together. my dropper post wont come back up its own. ive played around with the cable tension and that dint do anything nor is the seaport clamp super tight. is there something else should do. this is my first dropper post. am surprised by how light the wheelstires are. dint weigh them but there surprisingly light was expecting them heavy as hell
