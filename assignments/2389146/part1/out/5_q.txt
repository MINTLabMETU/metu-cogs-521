after having ridden few times my salvaged Fuji Royale II am starting notice that my wheels need some work there seems minor bit of wobble in both wheels. am debating between doing the work myself or taking the bike shop and having them do the work. as currently have only the one bike and dont want it out of action for any length of time while the wheels are being worked thought about buying second wheel set. thought would ask and see if people typically do that that is have two sets of wheels so their favorite bike is not out of commission when they have do work the wheels. also am debating whether it might actually more economical try and find cheap bike that can either swap the wheels off of or ride while am working the wheels or buy new or used wheels. am fairly tight budget so dont have whole lot of wiggle room make mistakes and am somewhat mechanically inclined but fairly new working bikes so doing the work will take me longer than most experienced people plus my time is somewhat limited. have no intention of riding any races soon so dont care about getting the latest hitch stuff just enjoy riding by myself the local bike path. example rode miles in the rain mph pace lot of fun and saw more deer than people. anyway if anyone has suggestions about getting second set of wheels and caveats would appreciate it.
