whatever. dude wants buy new bike. has. wonders if he should buy another. know from your posting history the only thing that matters is Is it expensive Is it popular but as far as the OP is concerned there is no problem buying another. guess Im just answering that question and not using the thread as another excuse for well worn rhetorical response. straight up question If one does need worry about parts and it int about fancy popularity issues what point is there worrying about whether wheel size is dead or not. if you have the bike and enjoy riding it what is the effect upon your experience
