it is dusty dry here and the sawdust here are very fine which makes the tires dirty white especially the Kojak. dont know but tolerate and prefer the tires with mud and soil but really do not like white dust the black tires. in my route there is this short dusty hardened desert that pass everyday. will try car tire stuff blacken them once in while
