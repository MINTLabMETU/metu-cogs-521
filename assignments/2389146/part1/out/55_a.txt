you call people names who think differently than you do then you talk about self-examination. you are not in good enough shape ride real MTB real MTB trails then state they all other bikes are better everywhere else as though your view of this is more important than those who want ride their MTB wherever just because they find it fun. you call people idiots for saying mabs are more fun as though the rest of are not entitled express our opinions as related the OP. you generalize that people riding mabs around town are riding low budget bikes. closed minded maybe. self-examination is difficult int it. bandeira mentioned getting in his base miles his fixed gear road bike. think he is completely CRAZY. however hope he does not care what think. think mabs are way more fun than road bikes and that is my answer the OP. hope each person actually has fun with the bike type they are most interested in. dont even care if they are closed minded about it as long as can have discussion that does not lower itself name calling unless know each other well enough friends and the name calling leads laughter. mabs rules
