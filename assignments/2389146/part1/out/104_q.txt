worked in bike stores before and during the arrival of mountain bikes. nobody working in shops the time was pushing mountain bikes for casual riders all took for granted that everyone should road bike and that the only riders who needed mountain bike were the few people doing hardcore off-road riding. but casual riders who tried mountain bikes took them immediately. they liked the upright riding position the stable handling the comfortable saddle and the ease and security of shifting gears without moving their hands away from the handlebars. result road bikes went from being of the adult bike market which tracks nicely with the proportions of the numbers of racers versus casual riders. the main difference is that hybrids have taken over much of the market slices formerly taken by mountain bikes and road bikes. but the mountain bike is still perfectly reasonable choice for the casual rider
