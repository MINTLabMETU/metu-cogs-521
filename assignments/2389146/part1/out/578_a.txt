use what works for you. live in hilly area. that means climbs in which use and when come back down use. use the whole range and sometimes miss bit more the top end mainly some asphalt stretches th. where the advantage of. lose lot of range which currently use and gaps between gears are so huge there pity flat areas. but what kills me is that paid a for bike with full manitou fork and Elixir Brakes. as parts wore down replaced the wheels with Fulcrum Red Power XL the brakes with six and fork with contour Axon lrc and hacked the rear shifter go from sp. all for less than a. the bike was lightened by almost in the process. when looking new bikes see a bikes with basic devore brakes reckon forks other low end components and that weigh almost kg more than my bike. cant get around that. its just cheaper keep my better built bike running for more years. see no reason leave my bike since as of today have not had any problem sourcing parts
