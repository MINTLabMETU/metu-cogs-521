honestly believe ers are the next big thing. most of the world rides ers. most of the world are relatively shorter smaller people. the western recreational cyclist is almost boutique niche market for bicycles where temporary marketing fads dominate. ers are seriously problematic because they require percent more effort generate the same amount of torque have higher center of gravity enormously stretched out wheelbase that hinder manoeuvrability weaker and heavier wheels and tires. its difficult or impossible design effective geometry for inch wheels suitable for shorttonormalheight riders. the front end is always going too high the wheelbase is always going too long. wheels were remarked mitigate these problems while maintaining viable but faddish business opportunity. is the death knell for. not anytime soon but eventually. makes sense with skinny tires and lightweight wheels as road bikes but not so much as they become bulky and heavier in mabs. think that ers will eventually dominate the gravel bike market because theres no significant benefit the skinny but heavy tuneless tires gravel bikes. gravel bikes give you wheelie combo that weighs about the same has about the same size wheelie diameter but gives you lot more traction lot lower pressure. theres some benefit larger wheels fully rigid mountain bike but the costliability is significant enough favor smaller wheels
