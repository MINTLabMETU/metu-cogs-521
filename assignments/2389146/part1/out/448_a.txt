yes downturn has some internally geared models but it is the combination of the internal gears replacing the front depailler and double or triple chairing AND pp rear cassette that would give you sp gearing with low gears in the midnight teens and high gears over and. you simply cannon have that kind of range wheel any other way and IMO if one is not going get that kind of total capacity out of front depailler project then the stock setup with wide range rear cluster and front ring need not messed with. the and sp internal hubs offer decent range and gear spacing but cost is issue. weight too. am not sure that the SRAM hub is terribly more expensive than obtaining modern d chainwheels shifter. the SturmeyArcher hub is cheaper but fitting cassette onto it would tricky. the SRAM hub is built exactly for that purpose.
