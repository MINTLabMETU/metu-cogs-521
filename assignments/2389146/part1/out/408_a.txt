sigma have two DTs Mini and viii and Im planning taking them sailing adventure next year. it sounds like really need do this mod as getting wet perhaps even with salt water is given. so which BB and crank set did you end up with and how much did they cost. do you think this is something the average person could change out their own or do need take it the LBS. my bikes are only couple of months old and havent been ridden in the rain or gotten wet all. thanks
