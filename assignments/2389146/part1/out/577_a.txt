have year old mountain bike. its my only mountain bike and it still works perfectly. fair Ive wanted replace it for some time but when look the market see no reason do it. just dont like whats available have spend least twice what my current bike cost have new bike with similar weight. just hate. it lacks range compared my triple and the steps are huge. just cant consider it. is bearable but still lacks range. just dont get it. most current bikes have crappy components compared my bike even if they cost twice what paid years ago. ive tried and made zero difference my ride times not that care and felt like driving bus. hate modern ultrawide handlebars with passion. who designed that uneconomic crap. know its easy cut them but why do all modern bikes come with that POS. which also makes me wonder why bar ends are out of fashion. there ergonomic give you multiple hand positions weight nothing and are really useful for XC. it seems me that everything revolves around aesthetics now. so here am. as long as there are parts available and it does break in half think Im not going replace it.
