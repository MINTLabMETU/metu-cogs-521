my frame failure was due error in the machining of the lower seat tube.it was actually honed offender leaving one side of the tube thinner than the other. this problem has been rectified in later model Swifts bought my original Swift in. checked the wall thickness of the seat tube my new Swift with calipers and the tube is perfectly concentric my old one measured mm or so thinner the cracked side. the redesigned Swift will have new seat tube with thicker wall for added strength. eta for this new frame has not yet been announced. im very confident in the current Swift frame for reasons Peter Steve and Karl have been very proactive with my frame issue thanks again guys unknowingly rode my Swift for over week with the cracked seat tube with fully loaded messenger bag sas potholeinfested streets without any hint of problem except for slight creaking sound in the frame whenever was out of the saddle All door Swift frames come with lifetime warranty. you really have nothing worry about. as for the brakes since your going drop bars just keep the stock brakes and go with Dia come V pro road levers designed for brakes. yangmusa has set his Swift. pm him for details
