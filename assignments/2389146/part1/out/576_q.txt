well the nightmare has begun again. noticed the tire was losing air. its leaking from the valve. pulled the valve out and did the method of using small piece of rubber from old tube and putting the valve through that help it seal made sure the tape was trimmed around the hole and its still leaking. apparently it could leaking from anywhere and my last option is pull the tire and retake it or some BS. and of course already put the sealant in it so now that will wasted. tuneless freaking sucks. straight up sucks. might make my hour round trip the shop have them do it then sell the god bike and just ride my old annandale
