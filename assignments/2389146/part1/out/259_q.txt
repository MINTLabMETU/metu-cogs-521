this is the last change will make my Swift until the next one. fitting rear rack turned out easier than thought. had old mountain bike rack lying in the shed and it looked as though it would fit my Swift without affecting the folding system. it is not special rack for small wheeled bikes and think any commercially available rack will fit the bill. used the fittings from another touring rack which featured flat and fairly flexible arms attach the rack the rear wheel stays. the upper arms bend quite easily and can bolted the Swift using plastic covered clips. the graceful curve in the arms add some stiffness and solidity the rack and it does not interfere with the folding much all. the width between the bent arms prevent the seat pillar sliding all the way down but it should still slide far enough contact the rear wheel keep the bike together. each rack different in that respect. if you want fit rack then think any mountain bike or touring rack which uses flat arms will do the job. my completed rack feels very secure and is the perfect home for my age rack top bag. this bag has small panniers which fold out from its side but still keep clear of my heels size shoes UK size. would not like try heavy camping gear it but for general use it works well
