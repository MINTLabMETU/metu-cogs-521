agree that the Swift is more responsive but Im able comfortably ride mine handed and Im not especially acrobatic cyclist. while havent ridden it century yet though intend Ive done couple of mile rides and found it comfortable enough. too am using narrow high pressure tires stevie psi but will put something wider Marathon Racers. when they wear out in the interest of more comfort and perhaps somewhat less responsive front end. dont do many group rides mine but thats because its fixed gear which brings its own issues when riding with others. im not really disagreeing with Bacciagalupethe Swift will not behave the same as road bike. but the differences are surprisingly minor me least. jack
