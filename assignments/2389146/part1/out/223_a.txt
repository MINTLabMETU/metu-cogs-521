ok was looking schwann crossfire inside Canadian Tire and noticed that between the drifters and the crossbow or interrupted levers the crossbow levers seemed like dint need pull lot get the brakes work. with the drifters had the impression had pull farther longer get the brakes the rim. like are shortfall brakes going get there faster then you start pulling the brake levers
