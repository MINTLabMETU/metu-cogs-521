what is worth mentioning regarding that case The bike in question was Tern Cargo Node cargobike basically consisting of Tern Node Frame thier bike with factory fitted tricycle rear frame cargo extension. do not know if the frame of the cargo node is different or stiffened in comparison ordinary Tern Link frame though optically identical for the innocent watcher. the poster says he had no heavy load the bike the time of the accident just himself lbs and laptop he had fitted electric motor the bike. bang based niddrie motor the bottom bracket. the bush is rated Watts. tern themselves do sell the cargo node with electric niddrie motor but only one with Watts. the force of that retrofitted motor is clearly far higher than what Tern offer themselves so basically he used the bike outside the specification. the poster himself writes in said geddit seems is not even allowed post the here thread He posted more pictures of the break incur As usual do not know if the breakage developed over time or happened completely all of sudden maybe starting secretly the underside of the frame. so while it is the same wellknown area where the bike broke it seems maybe bit questionable in this case simply claim it was Tern who still are unable weld. with the extra force of that extremely powerful motor the bike was used far out for what it was designed specified rated and tested. luckily the rider did not suffer injuries. maybe sign of warning people put the most powerful motors any given bike wo knowing the limits or paying respect or attention the forces that the frame will have deal with. just because things fit mechanically it does not mean it is good idea or valid combination
