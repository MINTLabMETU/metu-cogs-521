would agree about the better Vs compared the low end discs. however not in the snow or rain. water is the enemy of rim brakes all rim brakes. if your planning doing lot of snow riding discs are the best bet. if is issue try salmon colored woolston pads in your Vs. they work best under wet conditions and do make difference. btw nice looking Rockhopper. still have my Im saving it for my son when he returns from europe
