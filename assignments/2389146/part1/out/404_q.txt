here is thread the bottom bracket forum httpwww.bikeforums.netshowthread.wntubeEnglish. this is fun bike modify. despite the fact that it has hinge the frame is stiff. still its kind of funny modifying such basic bike with high-end parts. this bike folds quickly has stiff frame and rides very well if you tune up the stock parts. much better than damon. but it produces large heavy folded package that does stay together without bungee chord. if you shave pounds from the bike it will turn from oversized heavy box oversized box kind of like trying carry empty refrigerator carton. one argument for expensive mods is that you can bring the components up spec for damon and produce better riding bike that also performs well uneven pavement. putting level stuff this bike is bit over the top. also careful if you actually do fold and walk around with this bike lot. no matter how careful you are you will bump it or others will bump it and scratched carbon cranks can dangerous. that said feel like Im being spoil sport. have fun with the mods and keep up date. changed the tires and pedals and am waiting try the saddles recommended above. the best mod was rebuilding the wheels with the same hubs and rims. having steel ring crank seems bit low-end but it performs so well Im not in hurry change it. not sure what the cranks are costing in weight but sure heavier than the TruVativ sp cranks midrange hon.
