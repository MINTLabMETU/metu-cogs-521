thanks for your ideas. im not sure if get your extrasteps though. austria trains are far from being escorted by grim MPs even if the conductors are little beefy sometimes. but guess they are like that everywhere. slightly off topic recently saw excellent movie about uncanny trainrides that perfectly reflects the of European trains. from the danish director Lars von Trier. see this movie if you get the chance. it is outstanding. but it is different in reality Anyways the posting gave me the idea modify old worn out that looks wonderfully used. think it even has patched bulletholes. it might fit well and would very stylish. ill post some images as soon as got my bike in there
