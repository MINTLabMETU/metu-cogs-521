the bike has only been wet from dew couple of times never rode it in the rain nor has it had any salt spray it. its normally very dry here so dont have salt corrosion problems like they do in Florida where its humid most of the time. so yes live near the water but no dont think that was factor maybe Im wrong. the bike is only couple of months old and figure Ive put about miles it. the BB started making noise last weekend creaking. the LBS called say that its done so they must have gotten it out ok. ill report what they tell me when pick it up this evening
