like cantilever as well. have had them several bikes as am typically bit of CV guy and have owned and ridden several mid early mabs. one thing really like about the cantilever brakes is that there is lot of adjustment possible as far as how much mechanical advantage you want. like run the yoke pretty low get really powerful brakes
