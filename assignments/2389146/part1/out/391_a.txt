wheels are much better uneven terrain especially cobble stones than wheels as can tell from experience with my animal Joey and various folders. there is the schwab Kojak in which would consider sufficient road tire the Helix as most folders is is my opinion not high performance road bike anyway. regarding the hello Ive ridden prototype while ago and while it was ok neither the ride nor the design have impressed me too deeply. obviously mm matter of taste. the hello has suffered from massive delays as well and while they claim they would start delivery in couple of weeks early chances also seem never have been better succeed for the Helix as well now that they finally have test bike. personally find the Helix far more interesting than the hello but again YMMV.
