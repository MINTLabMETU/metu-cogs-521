well lets go back top the original question This person can go out tomorrow and buy brand new bike. it will last for years hopefully and they will have no problem buying parts. why worry if it is dead. how would that effect this rider in any way. its non starter question and supposition just something people say because they like pronounce things. what does anyone get out of stating certain bikes are dead. what is the pay off unless you are buying stocks in future bicycle sales. in world where you can buy just about any style off the shelf or get builder make whatever you want as you just suggested the OP in the crowbar thread such statements seem limited those viewing bike ownership as popularity contest and are afraid of being caught the wrong side of fashion
