jump down off curbs my toughroad regularly in the process of avoiding traffic snarls. but couldnt do it racer like you say its risky such bike. also regularly ride up over sloping one onto grassy median strip while crossing busy divided road near home. with the toughroad can do this safely just put my bum back over the seat unload the front. its lot safer than riding up meters the nearest opening with cars and trucks zooming past mere foot away. when you have bike capable of such you learn all kinds of shortcuts. the Giant toughroad is fast flatter roadie but with off-road abilities. great technological advancement in cycling
