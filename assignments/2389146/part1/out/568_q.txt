still maintain stable of mountain bikes. yes there old and outdated in comparison modern mountain bikes. but for the trails that ride which are mostly hard pack double track and carriage trails modern mountain bike is not required. is cheap and perfectly suited less demanding off-road fun. heres old lugged Trek that just brought back from the dead. this is the Rockhopper that use for bikepacking.
