sorry all can remember about cantilever my two vintage bikes that have cantilever brakes is that one needed new semi custom fork and the other project was never completed. for some reason older touring and cyclocross bikes had cantilever posts that were installed with very narrow center distances of mm. more recent bikes with cantilever have much wider post centers. never did find bracelets with the right geometry for older steel bikes. literally had fork built with modern post center distances so that could use modern cantilever brakeset.
