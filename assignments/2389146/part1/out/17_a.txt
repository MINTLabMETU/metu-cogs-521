those links dont seem work anymore. anyway couldnt buy new road bike with triple your bound have problems with it and wont feel like riding it. my friend bought cheap bike like that the thing never shifted properly and is now gathering dust outside his home he couldnt even ride it the store. good used bike would much better imho but one thing you have make sure is fit. medium should good fit for you in most brands
