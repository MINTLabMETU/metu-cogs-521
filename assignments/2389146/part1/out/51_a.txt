perhaps you are scopelocked mountain bikes with dual suspension knobbly tires and wide bars. yes this is one type of MTB but there are many being ridden road that have no suspension smooth tires and short bars. my aluminium Giant Yukon is of this latter type run smooth x tires PSI it and while the ride might not as harsh as that experienced racer it has good road characteristics. add SPD pedals and shoes raise the seat the optimum height and you have great roadie. of course having MTB strength can go seamlessly from road rocky ground in pursuit of the most practical path. most cyclists road are of the opinion that because the law says they have the right there they are inherently safe there. dont hold that view myself think you are safe when you are safe but when you bike can only handle smooth road what choice do you have
