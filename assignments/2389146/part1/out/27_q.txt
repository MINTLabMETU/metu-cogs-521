it would have been perfectly reasonable road bike in its. but the bike as described in bicyclebluebook is in its original configuration as road bike with front and rear shifting the craigslist posting youse linked is singlespeed conversion possibly fixedgear but Im not sure. if your actually looking for singlespeed and it fits you and its working fine thats not unreasonable deal. this is also the reason that the bike is only lbs. even if you do want singlespeed or dixie Im nervous about the vertical dropouts. most singlespeed bikes without chain tensioners use horizontal dropouts for the rear wheel so that you can set chain tension easily with wheel position. when they have vertical dropouts they need mechanism such as eccentric wheel hub that allows chain tension manipulated. make sure that this bike has such feature before you buy otherwise its possible that its only craigslist because its failed conversion in which case it would need significant extra work get it running properly
