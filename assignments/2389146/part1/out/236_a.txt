thanks for the insight guys. had actually already considered that somebody might have installed anti levers but havent bothered try and figure it out. though probably should find out how make the determination so know whats in my parts bin Ill goole that next. guess just dint bother because knew the very least would need swap out the levers and should install new cables the same time. also need new brake pads and since am going that far might as well slap some top notch brake arms while am it since they are cheap the moment. if nothing else just want find out how well highly rated brake system can perform for curiosity sake as much as anything else
