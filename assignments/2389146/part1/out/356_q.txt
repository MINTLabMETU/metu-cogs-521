helix bikes are welded inside inert vacuum chamber mitigate problems working with titanium. what is puzzling though is there cannon possibly inert vacuum chambers large enough accommodate anything the size of fighter jet aircraft.That means either inert vacuum chambers are not really necessary effectively work with titanium or the most sophisticated fighter jets have structural integrity problems. neither observations are consistent with all the type about subsonic titanium bicycles. nearly am waugh. exhausted but just cant fall asleep
