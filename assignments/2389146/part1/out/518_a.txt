agree with Yan want suspension all the time. the design of the birds suspension is good theres minimal bob when riding along even with fairly high effort. ride quality is similar my wife Moulton TSR. the only scenario where could see lockout being useful is if you like stand and hammer lot any suspension bike will bob in that scenario because your whole body weight is bouncing up and down. guess standing vs. sitting is matter of personal preference but if you look professional racers they tend sit most of the time except for sprints so standing is clearly not needed for performance
