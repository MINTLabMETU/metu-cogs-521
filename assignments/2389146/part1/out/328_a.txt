hi big boy phil Alex westmore publishes bike vs. swift article his webster which is worth read. for background own custom built steel framed road bike designed for me by australians best bike fitter. bike Pocket Rocket Pro. customised door Swift. bought the Bike because it packed up in suitcase making it easier travel by air. unfortunately discovered the Swift id bought the Bike. built up the Swift because of problems had folding the Bike. proposed elegant solution the BF folding problem above. why didn't think of that. thank you. prefer ride the full sized bike a the Bike or the Swift will never replace it until cant throw my leg over the big bikes saddle. the BF and Swift are twitchier due smaller wheels higher bottom brackets and fork offsettrail dimensions. properly configured either can hang with the big boys a and havent noticed any discernable difference in handling between them. your main problem will gearing. front chain ring and modified care or if your happy pumping max of gear inches peed cassette should work just fine. note that difference in the rear cogs is not as discernable a wheels as it is a wheels so you can live with bigger jumps etc in the rear cluster without detracting from the road bike look and feel. if you can live with the slight weight penalty the SRAM Dual Drive or roelof are the go for multi gearing small wheel bikes with one front chain ring. depends what you need and how much you can afford. bike not duplicate your position your favourite bike. as far as know the Pocket Rocket frames are built with fixed degree head and seat tube angle. also the frames are built in cm virtual top tube increases from somewhere around cm through cm. if you like riding with stem length between mm and your road bike seat tube is degrees you have compromise your road bike position BF. if was asked choose between Bike and Swift with identical components id come down the side of the Swift because it would cost much less while providing the flexibility configure it as you please. its only drawback is that it comes in one size and the seat post is fixed. ibm surprised with bfs change of heart about fixes because it certainly promoted them last year its old web site and dedicated considerable space BF riders single speed and dixie bikes and their exploits. think it even offered one in its range. see post the top of page is contemplating the front derailed route Swift. whether brave or clamp remember that the chain slopes from the chain rings the rear cluster small wheeled bikes that is the chain is not parallel the ground as it is full size bike so the derailed tab needs offset from the seat tube not it. if the seat tube angle is degrees the d tab will probably less than this ibm not sure how much but it shouldnt too hard work out with little math. looking forward seeing how you and kb go. oziswift
