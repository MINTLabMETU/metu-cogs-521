interesting and true. mountain bikes are popular because for most people they are general utility bicycles comfortable ride while firmly seated the widest saddle lowered take less effort keep moving comfortable with wide and often underinflated tires. mountain biking is unrelated. dont know what fraction but say large percentage of people riding attire bikes have never been mountain biking or trail riding. really riding MTB takes full-body conditioning coordination and technique. and none of that comes in the first couple rides. sure someone who can ride bike can clear some obstacles but steep climb loose dirt with roots and nine-inch step-up two thirds through while nothing for most MTB riders took this road rider while learn clear. look forward regaining my health and fitness sufficiently that can go back out and embarrass myself some Intermediate trails. after several rides the Easy trails just relearn the basic discipline. think most people who buy mabs would as scared ride real MTB trail as they would ride the road in urban traffic. fine with me. if they stay the sidewalk dont run into them or off-road
