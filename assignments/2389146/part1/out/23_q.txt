im hoping start building but have no knowledge or experience. im going for clean simple contemporary look along the fixed gear realm but with multiple gears. frame up build. im hoping for some wisdom as where start what avenues pursue and what avoid. really like the aesthetics of fixes but am more cityroad inclined so with more than gears. dealers are fine but as clean and simple as possible. classy timeless look. ill applying custom paint design. not sure what yet but Im going very picky as the looks of the gears the spokes handlebars materials etc. possibly some product sources and technical literature. thanks everyone
