sesamecrunch one of the reasons modern bikes shift well is they have teeth the cogs and chairing that have been cut down make it easy for the chain come off for faster shifts under power. side effect is that bike with no front depailler you have natural spot for the chain fall off. you also have peed cassette which both means wide sidetoside flex in the chain as you go from one extreme the other. cures include keeping chain tension fairly high by making your chain no longer than it needs but the dummy front depailler or plastic roller modify skate wheel if your cheap work the best. you really dont want the chain falling off even moderate speeds. you could try and find older chairing without the pins and ramps of modern ones but it would bit wide for the nine speed chain. the plastic and metal rings that can bolted your chairing dont always keep the chain from falling off. they do keep it from falling off the cranks and keep the loose chain from going into your back wheel but you just wedge your chain between the ring and the guard. that is why the depailler approach tends work better. like your modifications and will making similar ones soon when my vii gets here. it will my first new folder in about years. last one died after damage the crank and chairing by the airlines
