bought similarlyspecced birds newoldstock off bay for in so it does seem bit pricey for what it is. well mine had peed care setup and fixed stem so it wasnt identical. the plus side that one has the adjustable stem. im tall and one of the reasons sold mine in the end was that the nonadjustable stem was just too low for me and couldnt find replacement here in the. also although drivetrain parts are available as Bruce said it can hard find tires. havent looked lately but choice was extremely limited last time checked
